<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Agreeably</span> to announcement in the “Light from the Spirit
World,” I am able to present this volume to the public, under
circumstances which will be gratifying to all those who are the
friends of Progress and Reform. No pains have been spared to
present the precise words chosen by the author, and preserve the
style and sense of the original manuscript. In regard to the
merits of the production, it must speak for itself; for, whatever
of merit or demerit it may possess, I am worthy of neither praise
nor censure. Astounding as may be the assertion, that I had no
will to write it, or exercised any other control, than to let my
hand be moved by an invisible influence, and write as it would,
without any volition on my part, yet it is, nevertheless, true.
And, I am quite confident, that out of the two thousand writing
mediums, now in the United States, no one in a passive condition
will be able to contradict the assertion. Indeed, I have found
by actual experiment, that, in a great many instances, the spirit
who controls my hand, has succeeded in writing sentences contrary
to my will, and while I was endeavoring with all my volition,
to write something else.</p>

<p>But, so far as the orthography and punctuation of the Pilgrimage
are concerned, I have exercised supervision. And yet, much aid
has been afforded me by spirits in this matter. They arranged
all the paragraphs and sentences. The initials, which represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
different minds, were added by myself, to aid the general reader;
and also the division of the work into chapters, with the prefatory
contents of the same. Never having written a book in my
life, excepting with the control of spirits, who have now given
two volumes to the public, in about eight months, it may occur to
the reader, that other divisions would have been preferable; but
I have made the divisions as they seemed to me most natural.</p>

<p>This work has been written with uncommon despatch. Consequent
upon the issue of the “Light,” in November, 1851, I was
seemingly wearied with letters on business and inquiries, in
regard to matters connected with spirit developments; so that, in
the brief period of four months, I have received about two hundred,
which demanded reading and reply. This necessarily absorbed
much of my time; especially, as very many solicited
information from spirits.</p>

<p>Near the close of December, 1851, I began to sit for this work.
I found my engagements such that I could only devote a part
of each day, and this part was frequently interrupted by strangers
who desired information on the subject. But the interruption
did not seem to disconcert the writer. Though often breaking
off in the middle of a sentence, the spirit knew exactly where to
commence, even without any reading of what had been written.
Notwithstanding these embarrassments, I found on the first of
February, 1852, that my manuscript was nearly equal to the desired
contents for a book; at which time, I entered into an arrangement
with the publisher, Mr. Dewey, by which I am able to
give this work a more extended circulation, and at less cost, than
I otherwise could have done, which I trust will be abundantly
obvious in its mechanical execution and neatness.</p>

<p>Concerning my condition while writing this book, I will say,
that when writing, the whole subject matter was entirely in the
dark to me. I would take my pen, and place myself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
attitude of writing, when all thought and care would be wholly
abstracted from my mind. As my thoughts vanished, my hand
would generally begin to move, and a word would be written.
Then I would know what that word was. When the first word
was written, my hand would be uplifted so as to leave a space between
the words, and proceed as before. In this way the book was
written. But when the spirit chose, I found my mind often, very
often, though not always, impressed with the word which was
being written. And some mediums inform me that whole sentences
are impressed upon their minds at once; but with me it
is a rare thing that I have more than one word at a time, and that
comes, as it were, while they are writing it.</p>

<p>Should the reader receive the instruction and pleasure from a perusal
of these pages, which I have while they were being written,
the reward will be very great. I shall condemn no one if they do
not read it, because, in my opinion, they will suffer sufficient loss
without it. There are none who need the consolation and reform
which spirits require, more than those who refuse to be instructed
by them; but there are many who will, as they have done, aim
their darts at both. They belong to a circle who deserve pity
more than censure.</p>

<p>With the history and death of Thomas Paine, I know nothing,
save what has been written by an invisible influence with my
hand. Having been connected with the ministry for over twenty
two years, I was not inclined to read his productions; and since
I have become a writing Medium, I have found no leisure to read
any book. In fact, my taste for reading the productions of human
wisdom is all absorbed in the divine. The spirit proposes to write
another volume, and when it is written, it will be published.</p>

<p>The Diagram will serve to explain the circles of wisdom, as enjoyed
by minds in heaven. There are minds in the body who
occupy the first, second, third, and fourth circle, according to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
diagram. But I would inform the reader, that whatever may be
the circle to which minds belong, in the rudimental or second
sphere, it does not separate one from another by an impassable
partition, so that one can not hold intercourse with another,
though occupying different circles. As different circles in the
body may converse together, so different circles in the spirit world
may do the same. The circles do not represent arbitrary lines of
division between spirits, but simply degrees of wisdom. That the
higher circles mingle with the lower, for the purpose of making
them wiser, is apparent from the whole body of this work. I
consider, therefore, that circles express the degrees of wisdom
and bliss which each spirit is qualified, as it is developed, to enjoy,
and not as forming a line of separation among the inhabitants
of heaven. The wisdom of heaven differs essentially from
the wisdom of earth, in regard to the real merits of the mind, and
its qualifications for enjoyment.</p>

<p>The style of some parts of this volume is unusual. A circle is
sometimes addressed in the singular number, where it would
seem to require the plural; but this departure from grammatical
accuracy, may be justified on the ground, that the circle were all
of one mind, or sentiment.</p>

I will relate the incidents of my experience. For some
weeks previous to my exit, my attending physician gave
me up as incurable. Still, he continued his visits, and
experimented in every possible way his ingenuity and wisdom
could devise, to control what he foresaw would terminate
in my dissolution. At length, approaching my
bedside, he said in a tremulous tone, “I fear you will not
live to see the light of morning.” I replied, in a whisper,
“I see no one, then, to do what will be required at my
demise.”</p>

<p>“What do you require?” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Only that my body be decently interred,” I responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>I saw he felt moved by my indifference, and I requested
him to invite the parish minister to make a prayer. He
did so. I was still unmoved by his pathetic appeals to
Heaven to bless my soul with the outpourings of his grace
upon me. I felt no solicitude about my fate. All seemed
dark and hopeless, with no ray of light to gladden the
soul of a dying unbeliever in revelation. I was willing to
see, but no light came to my relief. In this state of awful
gloom, when midnight blackness offered no consolation,
when the idolatry of monkish mockery gave no satisfaction,
and when no ostentatious show of worldly gain or
honor wearied my mind with their cares, I said, “what is
life?” I answered, “’tis but a dream.” “Then what
have I done which is not a dream?” I wondered. “There
is my Age of Reason, and is that a dream?” I saw no
dream in that work. It was a reality. It was my work.
I saw it was not a dream. There was what the minister
had not disturbed. He did not overthrow what it contained.
He prayed against my infidelity, but he did not
lessen my convictions in any position I had taken. No:
weak and worn out with disease as I was, he made no
issue with my attack upon his faith. He went away, and
I saw him no more, till no more of flesh and blood imprisoned
my spirit. I was well satisfied he was afraid of
me. I was never more satisfied of the truth of my book.
Still, it was not what I wanted. It did not aid me in my
lone chamber of weakness and destitution. It gave me no
solace, save the reflection that I had served the cause of
human freedom, and had triumphed over the dogmatical
assumptions of a miserable theology. I was not wholly
satisfied that I was altogether right, but I was very certain
that religionists were wrong. I saw the corruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and hypocrisy of those who professed to be Christians,
and I was persuaded that what they taught upheld them
in their hypocrisy. In this frame of mind, I neither felt
wounded by their assaults upon my work, nor was I
afraid of what would be my condition after death.</p>

<p>Near the close of my earthly life, I fell into a swoon,
and I saw what was more evidence to me of a future life,
than all I had ever heard or read. I saw my wisdom
isolated, and torn in fragments. There came near me one
whom I loved in my youth; one who was dear to me
when I was in my years of prime; and who cherished an
attachment for me, which even death had no power to
dissolve. She had passed away. I had wept over her
grave. I had mourned her death as the severest of all
possible calamities. We were united. Nothing but the
form of marriage was wanting to make us one in the sight
of the world. We were married. I loved her as I never
loved another. She was my idol; and never was homage
more sincere and fervent than that which I gave her;
never was my soul so willingly captivated as when I enjoyed
her affection. Never was my distress equaled as when I
saw her coffined for the grave. Oh, sadness! thou hast
no wisdom for the bereaved! From that day to the period
above related, I had no music like hers to cheer me
onward through the night of my corroded sympathy, nor
was there hope that we should meet on the plain of conjugal
affinity which we now enjoy.</p>

<p>In that swoon, I saw her as in the bloom of her virgin
innocence. She came to me and said, “Thomas! be of
good cheer, I am with you.”</p>

<p>“Half wise am I to believe in an apparition, or have I
lost my reason that I should see a ghost by my bedside?”
I wondered to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Be not deceived. Do you not see me? Here is my
hand, and here the ring with my name engraved, and do
you not know my voice?” she replied.</p>

<p>“Indeed, your voice I know; I know all; but what
are you?” may I ask.</p>

<p>“I am your betrothed, your confiding companion. I
have watched over you with more care than you would
have deemed necessary, had I been formally united with
you in marriage. I have come now as a spirit to remove
your doubts, and conduct you to a circle where the weariness
of the world will disturb no more.”</p>

<p>“A spirit! a spirit!” I said in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, a spirit, a spirit you mourned as dead, is with
you.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible? it is not—no, it is not.”</p>

<p>“It is possible. Never question what you know,
Thomas.”</p>

<p>“I doubt not my senses, but my sight.”</p>

<p>“Then take my hand, as you once plighted your love
to me, and bear me witness that what you feel is not a
delusion, nor my speech a mockery of heaven.”</p>

<p>I gave her my warm hand, and never doubted again.
But, ere the morning sun had appeared, I passed the portal
of death, and saw the neighbors and friends preparing
for the funeral. The minister was sent for. He came.
With uplifted hands he besought God to comfort the
weeping circle; but I saw he had no confidence that his
prayer would be answered. He bewailed death as a curse,
and mourned that Adam and all his posterity had no hope
in heaven, only in Jesus. He opened what he said was
the word of God, and read, “There is hope of a tree, if
it be cut down, that it will sprout again;” but what is man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
that the Almighty should call him to a new sphere, he did
not seem to comprehend.</p>

<p>As I stood near him during the whole service, I felt
moved to say, “Oh, thou of little faith; wherefore dost
thou doubt?” But my companion said, “He will not
believe though one go to him from the dead; he has Moses
and the prophets, Jesus and the apostles, but will he
not dispute their sayings?”</p>

<p>T. Can he dispute what he shall see and hear?</p>

<p>C. And did not <i>you</i> doubt me, Thomas? When I
spoke, and when you saw me, you said, “It is not
possible.” Though you saw my hand, and the ring on
my finger, you would not admit my presence. Then you
said, “I doubt my sight.”</p>

<p>T. And will he, a believer in spirits, do the same?</p>

<p>C. He will not deny spirits, neither will he admit what
he sees.</p>

<p>T. Why?</p>

<p>C. He will say, as you said, “I doubt my sight.”</p>

<p>T. But will a believer in revelation doubt, as I doubted?</p>

<p>C. A believer in revelation doubts, and will doubt, his
sight as soon as an unbeliever. Both cavil with the only
rule which nature has given them to determine the existence
of things, and their relation to each other.</p>

<p>T. Who, then, are believers?</p>

<p>C. “Hath not God concluded all in unbelief, that he
might have mercy upon all?” All are unbelievers. The
minister does not believe that you and I are present, and
hear his speech. He does not believe what we know, that
his belief is unbelief of the truth in many things: so is
his unbelief a denial of the truth in other things.</p>

<p>The minister concluded his service, and my body was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
deposited in the grave. I waited to hear the benediction:
“Dust unto dust is the law of nature; but the spirit must
appear before the bar of God to receive the penalty of
violated law,” he said, in mournful solemnity. The circle
departed, saying, “he was more charitable than was to be
expected. Paine was an infidel, and what could he do
less than speak what he believed. He was satisfied that
the deceased had no eternal life abiding in him, and it
was his duty to warn his neighbors of their danger.”</p>

<p>I left them, and said, “How long shall it be to the end
of these wonders?”</p>

<p>My companion replied, “The end is not yet. Progressive
developments of wisdom will appear, when the dark
cloud of superstition shall be removed, so that the light
of heaven shall not involve those on whom it falls in the
trouble of wicked men. The spirits of this sphere have
waited for the coming of that day, and come it will, when
opinions shall not triumph over facts, and truth shall not
be rejected because it disagrees with the errors of religionists.”</p>

<p>But to return to my exit. When my companion gave
me her hand, I faintly said, “God be praised,” and languished
into life. There was no other spirit near me,
when I closed my race on earth. I was not without her
presence a moment, though a short interval elapsed in
which I saw no one. She saw me in my chamber, and
she came to conduct me to wisdom which I had not
known. As a dear spirit, I loved her; but when I found
myself where I could see the body I once bore, and the
countenances I was well acquainted with, it was a scene so
wholly unexpected, that I was overpowered with joy, and
my whole nature suffused with intense gratitude to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
divine Being, whose name and mercies I had derided in
my weakness and ignorance.</p>

<p>The first object which I saw was my companion. She
smiled and said, “Thomas, thou hast passed over the valley;
fear no evil; I am with thee.” I could see what they
were doing with my body, when I was conversing with her.</p>

<p>It was not over an hour after I left it, till my spirit was
conscious of all that was passing in the house. I saw the
woman, who occupied the house, interested in preserving
my features from discoloration, and bathing my mortal
casement with wet cloths. She was not well satisfied
with the physician. He wanted her to ask the minister to
make a prayer, but she refused. He told her it was customary
on such occasions to invite the minister to pray.
She said “he would soon need something more, and I am
not in a condition to pay him for his services.” He told
her that he would settle all, if she desired. “I will not
make a mock of the thing,” she replied; “but to tell you
the truth, doctor, I do not believe in praying over the
dead.”</p>

<p>The next wonder, which I was permitted to see, was the
spirit of my mother. She was a mother; I was now a
spirit, and she came to me, and said: “My son, my child,
I call you, my child. The storm of contention has passed.
The angry tempest is now gone by. Here, my son, are
the realities of happiness. I have labored to make you
wise in the wisdom of nature, but alas! I was not successful,
only in a degree. I have now an opportunity to conduct
you where wisdom will be unfolded in measureless
profusion.” So saying, she bade me follow her.</p>

<p>In the mean time, my companion stood by my side,
and we both instantly obeyed. The angel mother led our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
way to a grave, which was being dug for my remains.
“There,” said she, “is the end of all flesh. There is the
grave of your dust, and though it shall be deposited in it,
your spirit will live forever. Such will be the end of all
living. Do you not hear the workman?” I listened, and
the thoughts of the poor man came up to my spirit in
wonderful sweetness, as he moved the shovel with its load
of earth. “Ah!” said he, “there are many who respect
the talents of the dead, but few who care for the living.”</p>

<p>I saw him as he filled the grave. I heard him say,
mentally, “No man liveth and dieth not. I have dug
many graves, but where is the man who will not work
when human bodies need a burial? Oh! what would I
give to know that, when my body is wasted in dust, I shall
live in heaven. But, alas! what do I ask? My soul weeps
to know what God has refused to mortals.”</p>

<p>“Do you see,” said my mother, “that nature is true to
human good, while ignorance conceals her worth?”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied my companion, and we went away.</p>

<p>As we left the grave I was well satisfied that the reflections
of the poor man were mournfully true. I was not
without misgivings that my Age of Reason sought not to
gratify the mind in its hope of immortality. I said, “when
will the day come that I can make known the truth, and
correct the errors of my work?”</p>

<p>My mother replied, “The world is not yet prepared to
hear such news. I will not wrong the truth by an attempt
to reveal it.”</p>

<p>T. But will not a day come when spirits can unfold
to mind in the body the wonders of this sphere?</p>

<p>M. When minds emerge from the darkness of their
superstition, and spirits can control, without wrong to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
medium, we can make known to them the wonders of this
world of life; but, while they are controlled by their superstition,
the revealment would subject the medium to
severe penal sufferings, and the execration of all who are
not controlled by us. The people are more tenacious of
their creeds than what is consistent with the safety of such,
as will be required to act in a wonderful manner to overcome
their errors. I see, that when Jesus came, he was
not opposed with more violent measures than religionists
are prepared to adopt to suppress whatever contradicts
their faith and practice. But there will come a day when
spirits can reveal the truth, without involving the medium
in trouble at the hands of its enemies, and when the inalienable
rights of mind will be protected by the voice of
public opinion. Be patient, therefore, my son; for the
coming of that day will change the gloom of the grave
into the joy of immortal rest. It will come with wonder,
and mind will understand that the tomb is not the home
of the soul.</p>

<p>The sun was now sinking behind the western hills.
Then I said, “why are midnight and mid-day alike to
spirits? Why is not the rudimental sphere developed as
mind is here?”</p>

<p>“I see you will wonder, Thomas. Are not the night
and the day alike unto God? Does he not make light,
and create darkness? Are not light and darkness the result
of causes which harmonize in the well being of mind
in the body? Must not the spirit, wearied with its load
of dust, have hours of repose and rest?”</p>

<p>“Very true,” I replied; “but why do they not see as
spirits see?”</p>

<p>“Our vision is not as theirs; when we see, it is because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the undulations of light, falling upon us, are unobstructed
by other things. You will find light without darkness in
your path, because there is more light in spiritual than
earthly bodies. Light emanates from particles of matter
thrown off from dense globes in straight lines, which coming
in collision with each other, produce a concussion in
such rapid succession, as to evolve what is called light.
The law of what is called the solar system, governs worlds
of other systems. A ray diverging from the sun meets a
ray from earth, which produces what is called friction
among the innumerable particles in their passage from one
point to another. This friction emits a blaze from the two
particles. These wonders are actually transpiring every
instant, within scarcely perceptible distances, so that no
darkness can exist when they occur. There is an ocean of
rays commingling in their destined course, and forced
along their pathway by attractive and repulsive forces in
the great economy of nature. Now, it is only the grosser
particles, migrating from one globe to another, that make
light to the inhabitants of the rudimental sphere, while
spirits are able to discover light, or, as I would say, see the
friction, or light, emitted by the friction of lesser rays coming
in contact with each other. When the sun is visible
to minds in the body, rays from it fall in direct lines to
earth, and rays from earth pass in direct lines to the sun.
When rays pass in direct lines and meet, the concussion or
friction is greater than when striking each other obliquely.
Hence, the greater the friction, the greater the light. And
the nearer to earth the contact of the rays, the more sensible
the effect upon the retina of the human eye. This
accounts for the darkness called night, and the light called
day. At night, the rays, migrating from the sun to earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and earth to sun, must strike each other obliquely, and at
a greater distance from the eye of man. But spirits are
aided by the friction of infinitely more refined particles of
matter meeting the inconceivably more refined particles
of earth, occasioned by the influence of other planets upon
it. As the attractive and repulsive forces are equal to the
density, distance, and magnitude of the several orbs, so
are the rays refined; and you will find that the balances
are in just proportion throughout the immensity of the
Creator’s works. We see that refined particles, or rays,
more clearly give light to us, than the grosser particles,
emitted by stronger attractions, do to minds in grosser organs
of sight. Every thing is adapted to its condition.
Nothing is unwise in the order of the divine government.”</p>

<p>But, when we were at the grave, I saw no mind relieved.
“Thomas Paine was an infidel,” said they. “He ridiculed
the Bible. He was not moral, even. He was addicted
to intemperance. He lived with a strange woman. He
would not repent, and be converted; and he died without
having experienced religion. He must now atone for his
conduct.”</p>

<p>I wished to say, but wishes were vain, “My wrongs
were not wrongs of injury intentional to others. I had
erred; and I would, if I could, have atoned for those errors;
but my works were not worse than those arrayed
against me. I saw no religion worth possessing in the
creeds of men. I was not wise, but I could not find wisdom
in the doctrines taught by religionists. My desire
was law and justice; but neither were commended to my
judgment, in the forms and ceremonies of the church. A
change of heart was more mystical to me than the mythology
of the pagans. A wise man hath said, ‘wisdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
is mine,’ and what he said I was not ashamed to allow:
but I was ashamed to allow what I could not explain, so
that others could comprehend my meaning. I was not
without reverence for good, but what was good gave me
some uneasiness to determine. My rules were isolated,
and sometimes contradictory. Nevertheless, I would attempt
to draw up rules which I thought practicable, and
when I saw what was not wise, I was never ashamed to
acknowledge it.”</p>

<p>During the evening of the day in which my body was
interred, I was with my companion and mother, who proposed
to visit the house of the parish minister. I wished
not to go, for I was well satisfied of his feelings. I was
about to say so, when my companion resumed: “We may
not refuse crumbs when no more can be had. I see,”
said she, “he will not pray without wrath or doubting;
but it is all we can expect under his condition of mind.
He is now waiting to call the family together for prayers.”</p>

<p>“Then we will not stay long,” I replied.</p>

<p>“No longer than you wish,” she rejoined.</p>

<p>It was a still night. As we neared the house, the work
of reading a chapter was commenced by the servant of the
house. She read, with hurried words, the chapter which
was offered her.</p>

<p>“That seems to be an awful lesson of judgment against
the unbelieving,” said the minister, with a sigh. “Oh!
what would Paine give now, if he had made his peace
with God? I fear he is lost forever.”</p>

<p>“And why do you think so?” said the servant.</p>

<p>“Because he was a very wicked man,” said the minister.</p>

<p>“Are not all men wicked,” she faintly uttered?</p>

<p>M. Yes: but you know there is a sin unto death, for
which even Christians are not permitted to pray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>S. Did Paine commit that sin which is unto death?</p>

<p>M. I fear such will be found the case. He resisted
the Holy Ghost. He resisted prayer. He was opposed
to religion. Alas! he is beyond the reach of mercy. So
saying, he arose, and said, “we will pray.”</p>

<p>He was nearly through with a long prayer, when he
called upon God to “remember all who remember not
thee. Remember, Oh God!” said he, “all who are out of
the ark of safety; for we fear thou hast permitted one of
thy works to perish forever. Oh, God! spare thy rod, and
let not thine anger be kindled against thy enemies. Thou
hast mercy for those that love thee, and wilt thou not also
have compassion on those who need thy salvation?”
When he had concluded, I heard the servant say to herself,
“Who is my judge?”</p>

<p>I responded, by a gentle impression on her mind, “He
will judge others, but not as he judges himself.”</p>

<p>“It is even so,” she seemed to answer. “I never was acquainted
with Paine,” she said, mentally; “but he was
never convicted of any very great crimes that I have ever
heard; I wish others were as good as he. Then, I should
not be scorned because I am poor, and have to work for a
living. May be, it is all right, but I can’t see it.”</p>

<p>My companion rejoined, “Thus it is, and thus it will
be, till wisdom shall come from heaven, gentle as the dew,
and free as the air, to chase away the ignorance of a deceived
world. Never will mind rise up in the vigor of
wisdom, till celestial light shall dissipate the wrongs and
woes of misguided mind. I have seen the mind of man
groaning in despair, and no one to lift the burden from
his soul. I will not mock my inferiors, nor envy my superiors;
but I will lead you, Thomas, to a fountain where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
no impurity can be seen, and where you may bathe in
water without shore or bound.”</p>

<p>“But where do we go?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“We go where the weary find rest, and the conflicting
antagonisms of human society disturb no more. We go
where the pure will never become vitiated with wrongs, and
where rivers of light roll on, refreshing the mind forever.
We go where nature is understood, and her laws obeyed.
We go where truth is wisdom, and where no mockery of
duty answers the call of need. We go where we wish,
and when we go, we will not cease to remember that our
return will be cheered with music, vibrating in harmony
with human redemption from the whirlpool of angry
waters. We will not tarry among the wrongs and
evils of a mourning world, but we will visit a wonder away
from human cares, where order and harmony are appreciated,
and spirits concentrate to admire and glorify the
Ruler of unnumbered worlds. There is a world you have
not seen, a music you have not heard, a joy you have not
experienced, where the storm of contention lashes not
against its shore, nor the groans of distress reach the
borders of my spirit home.”</p>

<p>We went in company. But, at every step of our journey,
I saw new wonders, which I propose to write, with the
consent of this medium, for the instruction and enjoyment
of those who must ere long become travelers over the same
road, to a wisdom which none but celestial beings enjoy.
Therefore, wonder not who writes as you read; for my
name will be now recorded, as with the pen of a ready
writer, by whose hand I am permitted to subscribe myself,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I saw the wisdom of my new sphere, I was delighted
beyond the capacity of human expression. I was
not wholly a stranger in my new life, for I found a great
multitude of spirits whom I had known in the body. I
saw minds venerable while in the rudimental state. I was
well acquainted with George Washington, Benjamin
Franklin, Richard Rush, and many others. I saw spirits
teaching them lessons of wisdom. Then, I wondered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Why wonderest thou,” said a friend? “Thou hast
not yet seen what thou mayest see, when the clear light
of this world of beauty shall remove the darkness from
thy vision.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas.</span> And do I not now see more than I can
comprehend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> Truly, thou seest what thou dost not comprehend,
but thou canst comprehend even more, when thy
wisdom shall be increased. I was thy senior in life, but
thou knowest my history, in the settlement of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>T. Indeed, this is none other than William Penn—the
mind who never drew a sword to gain a victory, or repel
an enemy.</p>

<p>W. I am William Penn; I have watched thy course,
Thomas, and I have sympathized in thy efforts to rid
minds of superstition and priestly rule; but thou seest
now that thy labor was not successful, because the wants
of nature must be supplied. Hadst thou not attacked what
the mind wants—the hope of the soul in a future sphere—thou
wouldst not have found more opposers than sympathizers;
mind must and will strive to satisfy its own
wants. This is nature; and what is nature, thou didst
fight against.</p>

<p>T. But my weapons were not malicious.</p>

<p>W. No; thou wast not malicious, but thou didst what
thou wouldst not do again, as thou seest now. Thou
wouldst not write against revelation, because thou seest
that revelation is true to human wants, and is the bread
of the soul. Many things thou hast truly said, but what
thou hast truly said, will lose its power for good, because
it is found in bad company. I sought to make thee know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wherein thou didst err; and, on one occasion, when thou
hadst written a work on priestcraft, I verily thought I
should succeed in my endeavors; but I saw thee take a
book from thy library, which turned thy mind from the
impression I gave thee.</p>

<p>T. I see my error; but how could I see otherwise than
I did, when in the body?</p>

<p>W. Hadst thou, Thomas, studied opinions less, and
nature more, thou wouldst have seen that nature never
contradicts its own wants. It does not deny itself. What
nature wants, nature provides. Human opinions were objectionable
to thee, because they conflicted with nature
and each other; so with thy works. Thou wouldst battle
with others, because their opinions were irreconcilable with
nature, and yet thou didst offer thy own, though exposed
to the same objection. They saw thy errors, as thou beheld
theirs. When wise minds would correct, they should
adopt such rules as will not be objectionable when applied
to them. I saw thee, as I saw them, striving for mastery.
In this sphere, spirits never quarrel. I was more fortunate;
my aim was peace, and my success is well known.</p>

<p>T. How will you control, when minds are wilfully
ignorant and blind? My wisdom sees only that force must
repel force, when individual or national rights are invaded.
I will admit that kindness has great power over some minds,
but not to overcome the selfishness of despots and tyrants.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see, Thomas, that what is nature, is not
contradictory. I see that nature is just and true to all. I
see that minds are not just and true to nature, because
they are improperly cultivated. It is not natural for minds
to fight each other. It is inconsistent with nature for one
mind to control another, so as to wrong him—wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
both. Nature is well; but the wrong consists in not obeying
her voice. No mind is wilfully ignorant or blind.
The will is induced, sometimes, by ignorance and blindness.
All will of wrong is induced by want of knowledge
to perceive the injury it will occasion to the possessor and
others. No mind can will what is seen will produce its
own unhappiness, because it seeks its own good. To seek
unhappiness would be inconsistent with its nature. To do
wrong is to seek misery, because wrong induces misery. Ignorance
is the father of misery, for it guides the possessor in
the path of folly. When national or individual rights are
invaded, it can only occur as ignorance misleads the invader.
When human duty is not neglected, the invasion
can not be made. Thou knowest, Thomas, that nature
is good and just. Thou seest a chord of sympathy binding
all minds together. This is nature. Teach minds this
lesson, so that it shall see its relationship to mind, and it
will not invade the rights of others; because such invasion
would induce its own misery—a thing the mind must
naturally dread. Had the millions which have been expended
in war, been applied to the instruction of the ignorant
in the philosophy of peace, little necessity would ever
have existed to correct error with other errors, among which
the wrong of war ranks foremost. The selfishness of despots
and tyrants, would not exist under such a state of wisdom.</p>

<p>T. But we must take things as they are, and govern
them accordingly.</p>

<p>W. I would not have thee take others as they are not,
Thomas; but I would have thee understand, that the wisdom
of this sphere is peaceful, and not compulsory. Thou
seest no collision of minds, or disturbance among spirits.
The government, which controls minds here without force,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
is a government more perfect than that thy mind justifieth.
No spirit can be improved by evil. Evil is repugnant to
its nature. Force against force is evil, because mind must
harmonize with mind to be happy. The conflict of two
minds is a disturbance of nature’s law, and whatever is a
disturbance of nature’s law, is attended with consequences
incongenial with happiness.</p>

<p>T. That is true; but when minds are ignorant of the
laws of nature, ignorant of the relation of mind to mind,
and the essentials of bliss, they will trample on the rights
of each other. Under such a condition of things, is it not
wise to restrain by force the unwise and brutal?</p>

<p>W. When minds are ignorant, they should be instructed.
Nature demands this; and what nature demands,
mind has no right to withhold. Indeed, nature disciplines
minds who withhold obedience to her laws. Mind tramples
on the rights of mind, because it is ignorant; and it is
ignorant, because it has not been instructed, or received
instruction. It is no difficult task for mind to receive instruction,
nor is it unpleasant to give that which has been
imparted. I would have thee understand, that this lesson
can be taught to mind, ere it will need force to control it.
Nature itself would do this work, were it not baffled by
cruel and unwholesome precepts. It is false education
which disciplines the mind, so as to make coercive measures
apparently necessary in thy mind. Mind is educated in
wrong by precept and example, and then coerced by another
wrong to control it right. It is cultivated in wrong, and
then compelled to suffer for the wrong. Better far that
all minds were uneducated, than have them educated in
wrong. Education in wrong is what most afflicts thee.
No mind need stumble for the absence of light. No mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
will stumble, unless it walk in darkness. Let them see
before they walk, and they will not fall. No force is necessary
to control those who see, in order to keep them
from falling; neither is force required to prevent invasion
of another’s rights, under the light of nature. I see nothing
which wrongs any mind, where no force is exerted. It
is force against force which wounds. The wound is an
evil. It is an evil which force against force has no power
to overcome. If thou wouldst have others do right, thou
shouldst not do wrong thyself. Resist no good to thy
friend, or thy enemy; and thy example will not provoke
an invasion of thy rights. If he take from thee thy coat,
give him thy cloak also; for, in so doing, thy example will
lead him to return both, if thy want be greatest. He will
soon recognize thee as a giver of good things, and thy gifts
will lead him unto repentance. He will not steal from thee
because thou givest, and there are none who prefer to steal,
when they are supplied by gifts. None will fight, when
they have what they desire without it. None will do
wrong, when the wrong discloses no advantage. Study
right, Thomas, and right will not wrong thee.</p>

<p>T. But will not your precept lead the ignorant to expect
forbearance, and abuse your generosity?</p>

<p>W. It will lead mind to acknowledge, that what will
do them good is not an evil. It will do more. It will
correct the errors into which they have fallen by wrong
precepts. It will not make them abuse my generosity, but
disabuse themselves of their own wrongs. Thou knowest
what was not done, even by barbarians. When I saw the
red man, he never lifted his war-axe against me, nor my
friends. He knew I would not abuse him, and he could
not abuse me. But he could do wrong to others. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
could slay them without remorse. Canst thou explain the
reason?</p>

<p>T. The reason explains itself. I know you was successful;
but was not your success owing to your well regulated
treaty stipulations?</p>

<p>W. Undoubtedly, my engagements were honorably
fulfilled, as they were honorably made. I would not wrong
a mind, and then require that mind to forbear. I would
have all do right; and when mind does right, it need fear
no evil. Resistance to the injury of another, is not right,
and what is not right, would’st thou recommend?</p>

<p>T. No: but when savages invade, or tyrants oppress,
I would resist their misrule.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast well said; but how couldst thou resist
more effectually, than by acts of generosity and friendship?
Resistance with force against force, is encouragement to
wrong. It provokes others to do wrong. “Overcome
evil with good,” is not resisting evil with evil. There is
only one way, Thomas, to do good, and make enemies
friends. Minds, wishing peace, will find it with less sacrifice
in well doing, than in evil doing. All strife has
cost even the victor more than he ever obtained. All wisdom,
in this sphere, will show thee, what is not appreciated
in the rudimental. I see wherein thou hast erred. I
will change thy wisdom, that thou mayest sit down in a
circle where mercy flows like a cooling stream to refresh
the plants of heaven. Come thou with me, and I will
do thee good.</p>

<p>He led me where I saw a light exceeding the brightness
of a thousand suns. I saw a door opening a magnificent
temple, arched as it were, with stones of the most beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
workmanship, and clear as crystal. When we reached
the arch-way, he said:</p>

<p>“Friend: Art thou prepared to do the work required
of thee by the Master of this building?”</p>

<p>T. And what is that work I am required to do?</p>

<p>W. Enter upon thy apprenticeship, and obey thy
Master.</p>

<p>T. That I will do, in all reasonable commands.</p>

<p>W. But thy reason is not required, till thou art instructed
by the Master to reason with wisdom to guide thee.</p>

<p>When we had passed the first arch, I was reflecting on
my pilgrimage, which was so strange and new, that I felt
my soul overcome with the mercy of heaven. But my
guide aided me onward. On entering the second arch-door,
I was hailed by a workman, who said:</p>

<p>“Whence comest thou?”</p>

<p>My guide responded, “From Edom.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Workman.</span> Hast thou brought a stranger with thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guide.</span> A stranger has called to serve as an apprentice
in thy charge.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou examined the passports, and dost thou
know his integrity?</p>

<p>G. I have examined all, and find him worthy of our
confidence.</p>

<p>W. Then, wilt thou proceed to the station where wisdom
will be unfolded, and his duties and obligations made
known.</p>

<p>As we proceeded, an ode was sung by a great multitude.
It was unlike any thing I ever heard before. There
was a softness, a melody in the strain, that fell upon my
mind with angelic loveliness, and I wondered why I was
admitted into a society, where all was peace and harmony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and no discord grated the ear of worthy and tried servants,
in this sanctuary of heavenly wisdom. As I wondered,
I heard a voice saying: “What man hath rejected,
that thou hast found. I saw thee a stranger, and took
thee in; naked, and clothed thee; sick and in prison, and
visited thee. When thou goest hence, bear this lesson in
thy mind, that good may come unto thee from the good
thou doest unto others of thy fellow servants, who may
need thy aid and sympathy.” Then, I heard the multitude
say, “Amen.” “Amen,” I responded; and as I
spake this word, I found my voice had changed. It fell
so sweetly from my lips, that I was surprised at the sound.</p>

<p>My guide then proceeded to instruct me, that this temple
was none other than a miniature representation of nature.
“It is a building of God,” said he, “and here is
thy home. Here mayest thou worship, here bring thy
gifts, and consecrate thy vows upon the altar of spirit
progress, in the eternal realities of knowledge and virtue.
Here pour out the oil of consolation for the bereaved, and
here serve God by doing good to those who need thy assistance.”</p>

<p>I saw my name written in the record of eternal life;
and I was rejoiced when my errors were corrected. When
I was instructed, I saw my resistance to truth overcome,
and when I found how my own wrongs were remedied, I
saw how others might be reclaimed.</p>

<p>The temple was inlaid with gold. I saw a mind standing,
with elevated wisdom over his head, and at his feet
were sitting students of nature, who received instruction
from him. In his right hand he held a book, and in his
left a banner. The book was opened, and the banner unfurled.
“This is not made with hands” said he, “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
came from Mount Horeb, where the everlasting covenant
was given to the children of the Most High. Advance
stranger, and receive the blessing which thou hast refused
in thy unbelief.”</p>

<p>I stepped forward as if drawn by an attractive power to
do what was required, when he placed the book in my
hands, and said: “Receive this Revelation with meekness,
and make it thy study. Thou hast ridiculed without
reading; read now without ridicule. Turn thou not
from its light, but when thou readest understand. Seek
not thy own interpretation, but let wisdom conduct thee
in candor, to add nothing to or take nothing from what
thou hast no right, and which is not thy own.” The
mind then sat down.</p>

<p>I next saw the words on the banner. It was a beautiful
banner, filled with gems and devices; and when I saw
it, I read the words, “Justice, Wisdom, Progression, Order,
and Harmony.” Beneath it was written, “They
shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears
into pruning hooks.”</p>

<p>My guide then said, “Understandest thou what thou
seest?”</p>

<p>What will you say, I inquired of Justice?</p>

<p>G. Justice is not cruelty, but is doing what benevolence
requires. When thou seest a mind whom thou canst
aid, and unto whom thou canst render assistance, be it thy
friend or a stranger, then be just to the law which makes
thee and him companions, and recognizes the deed of
mercy as a deed of good to thyself. If he fall by the
way side, because he can not see, then take him by thy
strength, and bear him where he may rest. Put thy hand
upon him gently, and say: “I will not forsake thee till thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
canst aid others as I will aid thee.” Let him want nothing,
and justice to thy needy friend will be satisfied.</p>

<p>T. What is Wisdom?</p>

<p>G. Wisdom is wise. It is wise to relieve want. It is
wise to do good. It is wise to understand thyself, to know
thy dependence on others, to see the wisdom of God in
his works and wonders. It is wise to act, to say, and to
wish well toward all mind. It is wise to speak the truth,
to utter nothing but the truth, and to oppose nothing
which is good. It is wise to love, as we see love begets
love. It is wise to learn, because what thou learnest of
wisdom will add to thy circle of bliss, and the bliss of
others, when they are taught of thee. It is wise to co-operate
in harmony with the thousands who saw thee in need,
and aided thy welcome within these courts. It is wise to
obey the Master of this house; for in so doing great good
shall be thy reward, and thou shalt wear a crown which
the ignorant may envy, but can not pluck from thy head.</p>

<p>T. What is Progression?</p>

<p>G. Progression is the expansion of thy mind in the
wisdom thou mayest receive from instructed minds around
thee. When thou doest good, it is wise; and as thou becomest
wise, thy wisdom will swell thy mind with the
luxury it gives. Thou knowest from what thou hast seen,
that according to thy works of well doing, so shall thy
measure of bliss be. If thou wouldst do more to benefit
those who need, thou must be found faithful unto the instruction
thou receivest, and then thou wilt be prepared to
discharge thy trust with honor to thy station, and with
satisfaction to thyself.</p>

<p>T. What is Order?</p>

<p>G. Order is law. Law is immutable and universal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
When I say, Order is law, I would that thou shouldst understand
that it is obedience to law. Disobedience is disorder,
and disorder is anarchy. Thou wilt see that nature
is obedient unto law. Planets and suns, and systems of
suns and worlds, are all obedient to law. The least disturbance
might work a disorder, which no mind less than the
Creator could possibly control. As thou beholdest order
in the natural world, so let it be thy aim to observe order
in the society into whose charge thou hast committed
thyself.</p>

<p>T. What is Harmony?</p>

<p>G. Harmony is what we mean by social sympathy.
It is congenial with order. It is union of minds. It is
wisdom in unity of minds. It is sympathy of thoughts
and works. It will not divide and distract, convulse or
disturb the social enjoyment of the circle now assembled
to witness thy progress in the knowledge of the truth.
Thou wilt not do or say what will not be upheld and understood
by those whose integrity is vouchsafed to defend
thee in the cause of social refinement and peace. Hear,
now, what thy Master sayeth unto thee from the throne
of mercy.</p>

<p>M. Inasmuch, Thomas, as thou hast advanced to this
temple with the aid of thy guide, and hast entered the
courts of the glorified circle of this sphere, thou mayest
ask what seemeth good to thee.</p>

<p>T. Then, I would inquire, why are those words placed
on the banner which I see in your hand, and which seems
to indicate the end of collision among minds?</p>

<p>M. Thou hast well judged. The sword and the spear
will be converted into useful implements of industry, and
the banner thou seest wave in glory over the world of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
mind. Thou wilt not wonder when thou seest the wisdom
which thy progress will unfold to thee; for as the
sun is true in its relation to the planets revolving around it,
so will the prediction thou seest be verified, and nations
shall learn war no more. As thou hast been instructed,
so shall thy followers be, till wisdom shall unite all minds
in harmony, and order save spirits in weakness and ignorance
from their disorder and shame. Then will minds
see a victory without blood, a harmony without force, a
justice without cruelty, and a wisdom without folly.</p>

<p>T. But when shall these sayings come to pass?</p>

<p>M. That is thy work, as it is ours. Thou must know
that what is thy work, thou must not require others to
tell when it will be completed. According to thy labor
and thy skill, so shall the work prosper in thy hands.
But if we are negligent, so shall the day be, in advancing
upon mind.</p>

<p>The guide then took me by the hand, and said: “Now
thou art introduced into this company, it will be thy chief
desire to remember the instruction thou hast received, and
follow the counsel which thy seniors may impart to thee.
Thou seest many things here, and many more will be revealed
to thee, so that thy life will not be idle, but will be
devoted to the lessons as they will be given thee. I will
now introduce thee to a friend, who has a charge to give
thee.”</p>

<p>Leading me to the right a few paces, he said: “This is
the Master whom thou wilt hear; and as thou hearest, so
do ye.”</p>

<p>M. My son; hear the counsel of a father, and forsake
not the law of thy mother. These many years have I
presided over this circle, and my children hear my voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
They revere my advice, and yield me honor by obedience.
At my table thou wilt sit, and receive the bread thy mind
will need. Here, we welcome thee from the tears and
woes thou hast seen, and here shall thy mind be satisfied
with the abundance of mercy received and enjoyed by all
of us. But, when thou shalt go on thy mission, bear the
banner thou seest, and the glory of that banner shall
wave over the world with the smile of peace. Thus, thou
wilt see thy reward in the work thou wilt perform for the
good of mind in need.</p>

<p>When the Master had concluded his charge, my guide
said: “No mind can receive instruction without a teacher,
and no mind can teach the truth, unless he be taught.
If thou wouldst advance, Thomas, in the knowledge of
this sphere, thou mayest understand that thou wilt apply
thyself with all diligence to the work before thee. And
in order to make thee acquainted with thy care, I will
proceed to instruct thee in the use of those implements,
which are necessary to expedite the work devolving upon
thee.”</p>

<p>He then took a chisel and mallet, and said: “Some
minds are rough, and need thy labor to remove the uneven
surface. Take thou this chisel and mallet, and when
thou findest a rough stone, which thou seest can be made
smooth, then let thy strength be expended upon it, even
as we have sought to make thee serviceable in this temple,
by removing the roughness of thy mind. As thou seest
we have done thee no harm by rendering thee more beautiful,
and better adapted to thy position in this edifice; so
mayest thou work to render others what we have made
thee. But to aid thee in thy labor, thou shouldst take
this square and plumb, so that thou mayest try the stone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
until it squares with this rule, and works with this line and
plumb, when thou wilt see its use in the temple for which
thou hast prepared it. I have now given thee thy directions,
and trust thou wilt shew thyself a workman, who
will be faithful to the trust committed to thy charge.
What sayest thou?”</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt find thy servant faithful in all things.
But may I know my Master?</p>

<p>G. One is thy Master, but many are thy fellow servants.
He who controls as a father controls his children,
by the voice of kindness, is thy Master, and we are his
family. Dost thou not know who controlled thee, and
made thee obedient? He is thy Master. The mind that
controls others, is the Master of those whom it controls,
while those who are controlled by him, are servants to
obey his will. The Master is as the servant, and the servant
as the Master in the work required of thee. We
may not be controlled as slaves are controlled, nor yet as
slaves are worked; for our Master is not a tyrant, but a
co-worker with us in the good of all. He rules with attraction,
as the sun rules the planets. He rules with wisdom,
as he has received wisdom. Force has no authority
here, only as an attractive principle to hold the workmen
in a desired position—a position for which they are fitted.</p>

<p>T. When we serve one another, we are servants, I
suppose.</p>

<p>G. We are servants of good to them. But when we
serve ourselves by their industry, we serve them as slaves
are served. Thou wilt see we are free, and yet servants
of many. Dost thou see the eagle perched on that banner?</p>

<p>T. I see. He cries, “Many in one.” Many may be
one, and one many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>G. Truly, Thomas. Many may not be in one also.
Thou hast seen many oppress the few. Thou hast seen
the few victorious over the many. I know thy course
against tyranny. I saw thee when a stripling, in the cause
of freedom, but thou wast not as thou seest now. Here
freedom is not oppression by force. No mind will say
unto thee, “go, and thou goest; or come, and thou comest;”
because it is his will, and not thine. Here, thy
Master’s will is thy will, and what is thy will that thou
doest, as thou art required. When thy Master and thou
agree in all that thou doest, thy freedom is what slaves do
not enjoy, nor is thy servitude the bondage of slavery.</p>

<p>T. What rule will make him, thou hast called Master,
a master over the workmen?</p>

<p>G. The same rule, or law, which controls the material
world. As the sun controls the system of orbs that revolve
around it by its attractive power, so it masters or
controls them; and yet thou seest no inharmony or disturbance,
no resistance or oppression from the authority it
exercises. It is control, as we would have rule exercised
over minds. Nature is free; and what nature justifies,
that thou wilt not disapprove.</p>

<p>T. Can I not wrong nature and myself?</p>

<p>G. Thou canst wrong thyself by denying the laws of
nature; but thou canst not do what thy mind forbids thee.
Nature is denied, when resistance to attractive power is
seen. Nature is disobeyed, when oppression denies the
freedom which we enjoy. Thou camest to these courts
because thou didst desire more wisdom. No force was
necessary to bring thee here. No resistance didst thou
offer to the pilgrimage thou hast made. Thy will was as
free as air, and when thou didst come, it was control which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
brought thee. Thou wast drawn by affinity, by law of
rule and power over thee, so that thy coming was as free
as thy will, and thy will was as free as thy coming. Thou
wast drawn, and drawn as thy desire sought. When thou
seest, as thou wilt see, the harmony of this temple and its
just proportions, thou wilt not wonder at its arrangement,
nor need instruction to displace thy errors. If thou
wouldst be wise, let not thy prepossessions forestall thy
judgment.</p>

<p>T. But what must I do with these implements of industry?</p>

<p>G. Take them in thy charge, and with them this compass,
to aid thee in thy work. Remember, also, that
wherever thou goest, these thy implements shall be a sign
of thy masonry, and thy work thy recommendation among
thy fellow servants. As thou hast received them at our
hands, so use them as not to abuse the purposes for
which they were intended.</p>

<p>T. Have I no one to commend me, but these tokens
of my profession?</p>

<p>G. These tokens will reveal thy work, which thou hast
received, and thy work will not dispute the use of the
implements. Thy name will be known wherever thou
goest, because thy works will follow thee.</p>

<p>T. When I go hence, unto whom shall I go?</p>

<p>G. Thou wilt go as thou seest need of thee. Thou
wilt see need of thee where thy work will adorn the uncomely
things with the beauty and usefulness of this
sphere of wisdom. Thou wilt reveal with thy skill the
hidden beauty of deformity, and develop the intrinsic
value of mind, concealed beneath the rubbish of error and
wrong. Let thy dexterity and moderation be known by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
thy works, so that the whole building of God may resound
with shouts of joy.</p>

<p>When my guide had aided me thus far, he said: “Now,
Thomas, thou wilt turn thy face to the left, and receive a
lesson from the High Priest of this temple.”</p>

<p>I turned and walked about four or five paces, when he
said, “This is the High Priest. He has a message, and
will now aid thee in thy duty to those with whom thou
wilt henceforth be associated. Listen attentively to what
he may say, and let thy mind be opened to the words
which he may speak for thy benefit.”</p>

<p>As he arose, a mind said to me, “Kneel.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“This is the order when he speaks.”</p>

<p>I knelt, and he proceeded: “Thomas, wouldst thou
understand more of the mysteries of this company?”</p>

<p>I responded, “What is useful, I would not refuse.”</p>

<p>P. Open then the book, and read.</p>

<p>I opened the book, and read: “What man, having
an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the pasture, and go after that which
is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he
layeth it on his shoulders and rejoiceth; and when he
hath brought it home, he calleth his neighboring friends,
and saith unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found
my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, likewise, that
joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more
than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repentance?”</p>

<p>P. Thou hast well read thy lesson. Dost thou wish
an interpretation? I see thy mind responds, nay. Thou
hast well said, nay. I am not here to interpret what thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
understandest, neither would I have thee undertake to do
what that book forbids thee. Shouldst thou wish for more
light, thou wilt not find it without a revealment be made
to thee. What is revealed, is well, and what is not revealed,
thou wilt not find by any interpretation which thy
wisdom may see fit to place on the words of another.
Thou mayest interpret thy own words, but thou hast no
right to disturb the words of another, lest thy interpretation
be taken for the wisdom which instructs thee.</p>

<p>T. How then am I to understand this book?</p>

<p>P. Thou wilt understand, thy duty is not of thy own
construction of what is required by the just rule thou hast
received; for the book will serve thy harmony and peace
far better without interpretation, than with it. Thou wilt
see that angels do not need minds, who are lower than
themselves, to interpret what is above themselves. When
thou hast dispossessed thyself of errors forced upon thy
mind by education, thou wilt not need a commentary to
aid thee in thy duty. Hast thou not read, and dost thou
need an explanation of what thou hast read?</p>

<p>T. I need no explanation of that passage.</p>

<p>P. Truly, and when thou wilt read other passages, as
thou hast read that, then thou will say of such also, I need
no explanation, because thou will be guided by such impressions
as will unfold to thee the beauty thou seest in the
pasage thou hast read. Thou seest the prediction verified
in thy presence. Thou hast repented of thy sins, and thy
repentance has brought thee to these courts to receive the
joy of well done, good and repentant servant; enter thou
into the joy of thy Master, and sit down with us to this
banquet of good things.</p>

<p>T. I accept the offering, and trust I shall prove myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
worthy of the society whose kindness is a sufficient protection
against the sin of ingratitude. But will any mind
go with me on my mission?</p>

<p>P. When thou goest, then thou shalt have company;
but obligations are yet to be made known to thee. Thou
will not depart until thou hast received thy passports.</p>

<p>T. And from whom may I receive what is lacking?</p>

<p>P. From the mind who has recorded thy works. The
guide will now conduct thee to the inner court of this temple
where thou wilt receive thy passports, and from thence
thou wilt go on thy mission with thy companions, who will
aid thee and co-operate with thee in doing good to thy
fellow servants whom thou wilt bless with the blessing
thou hast received from this visit.</p>

<p>The guide said, “Follow me.”</p>

<p>I went. He conducted me to a circle whose countenances
glowed with continual brightness, and whose voices
were sweeter than the Æolian harp. As I advanced into
a large area in the center of a magnificent court, I saw a
light streaming from heaven, and a cloud of wisdom broke
upon me in ineffable glory. So great was that light, and
so dense was that glory, that I was uplifted like a bark on
a wave, but not to sink in despair. As I rose, I continued
to rise till my soul was willing to view the height and
depth of a mercy that never shuns misfortune, or conceals
bread from the hungry. “Here rest, Oh, my soul!” I
said to myself.</p>

<p>G. Why dost thou rest? Art thou weary with thy
progress?</p>

<p>T. I am not weary, friend, but my mind is lost in the
grandeur.</p>

<p>G. Thou hast well said. Remember, now, that thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
elevation to this position was not of thyself, but of that
cloud of mercy which bore thee, and on whose bosom thou
surveyest the pilgrimage thou has made. Thou wilt also
remember, that thy servants from whom thou hast received
instruction, have uplifted thee by their strength, so that thou
mayest see what thou now beholdest. In due time, thou
wilt be permitted to see other things.</p>

<p>Stooping down, he gave me a white stone with a new
name therein, which, said he, “no man knoweth but he
that receiveth it. This is thy passport, and unto whomsoever
thou shalt go of thy circle, they shall bid thee welcome;
and thou shalt not take with thee scrip, nor purse,
nor two coats, for thy garments shall not tarnish, nor thy
mind perish, because thou art denied sympathy and friendship.”</p>

<p>I received the white stone with the new name therein,
and when I saw the name, I wondered at its meaning.</p>

<p>G. Thou needst not wonder, Thomas, for what was
thy name in thy infancy, thou canst not bear with thee
into these mansions of light and peace. Thou wilt, henceforth,
answer to thy new name in this circle of wisdom.
Thou wilt now return with me, and when thou returnest,
offer this passport to thy Master, who will explain some
things to thee why thy name should be changed.</p>

<p>We returned. The cloud of mercy shone as brightly
and gloriously when I descended, as when I ascended. I
then gave the Master the white stone, when he said:
“Thomas was thy name in infancy. In infancy thou didst
not remain. Thou hast grown to the stature of a man.
When thou wast a child, thou didst speak as a child, and
understand as a child; but now thou art become a man,
thou shouldst put away childish things. Henceforth, let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
not thy name be called Thomas Paine; for thou wilt not
answer to a name which misrepresents thy true character,
since thou hast found favor which has instructed thee to
call no mind, ‘common or unclean.’”</p>

<p>T. Am I then to be called by a new name?</p>

<p>M. Thou shalt be called by this circle a new name,
which thou seest in the white stone thou hast received.</p>

<p>T. And wilt thou read the new name?</p>

<p>M. “Contentment.” Such is thy new name, because
such is thy condition. Thou hast sought for light and
perfection in the degree of this circle, and as thou hast
found, so thou art contented with thy finding. Thou wilt
not answer to any other name, when thou respondest to
the call of thy fellow servants. In thy infancy and childhood,
thou didst call mind “common and unclean,” but
now thou wilt do so no more. Thou hast seen that thy
mind was as thy fellows, but wisdom has shown thee that
what thou hast denounced as “unclean” in thy works and
by thy words, is not as thou hast said. No unclean thing
can enter here, because light and purity will cleanse the
immortal mind from the impurities of worldly wisdom and
ignorance.</p>

<p>T. But should I retain my old name when I converse
with other circles?</p>

<p>M. Thou mayest answer, but when thou answerest, let
thy signature be without dissimulation. Shouldst thy
friend recognize thee by thy infant name, thou mayest
respond; but when thou meetest a mind of this circle, thou
wilt be hailed by thy new name, and respond to its announcement.</p>

<p>T. Then a new baptism may be necessary. When
my infant name was bequeathed, I was baptized. Ought
I not now to receive a new baptism?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>M. Thou wilt proceed to the High Priest of this circle,
who will answer thy question.</p>

<p>The guide conducted me again to the chair of the High
Priest, who said:</p>

<p>“I heard thy inquiry, and thou wilt listen to my
answer. Thy baptism was not of wisdom, but of water.
When thou wast baptized, thy mind was not affected.
The outward man only became the subject of purification.
Now thou art introduced into this circle, thou wilt be
taught to put away childish things, and consecrate thyself
to the work of benevolence. To aid thee in thy work, I
will impress thy mind with the spirit of this circle; yea, I will
baptize thee in a fountain, which comes like a pure river
of water from the throne of wisdom. Reach forth, oh,
God! from courts of more than mortal glory, the oil of
gladness, and let thy servant be washed in the stream of
thy mercy.” Placing his hand upon my head, he said:
“The wisdom of God be upon thee, and give thee peace.”</p>

<p>When his hand rested on my head, I saw a stream
descending from wisdom’s holy court, gentle as the dew of
evening, and clear as the mercy of God. It came like
water in the rising tide, and overwhelmed my mind with
a flood of living light. I saw the stream, and the stream
carried away the question of baptism, and left me pure
from all doubt of its character.</p>

<p>“Thou understandest,” said my guide, “that water baptism
is for infancy, while the baptism of wisdom, which
thou hast been permitted to receive, is for minds of understanding.
This is the baptism of truth. This is the stream
of divine grace. This is the water of life. This is the flood
which shall never pass away. This is the sea without a
shore; and Contentment will receive wages. Contentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
is satisfaction with reward; and when thou goest
hence, thy reward will be with thee forevermore. Thou
wilt now rest with us.”</p>

<p>When the guide had ended his saying, there came a song
of sweetness. The whole circle joined in one melodious
anthem of joy, which was followed by an ode of order.
The words were words of sympathy. They touched my
feelings. I saw what was my delight, a society where
brotherhood was no unmeaning expression. I had found
a kindness which no mortal can understand while in the
body. I found a society unlike any thing on earth. It
was a society, linked in union by an immortal chain. It
was a home, where there was bread enough, and to spare.
It was a temple not made with hands. It was made by
the Grand Master Builder of heaven and earth. Its pillars
were holiness and truth, and its “chief corner stone,” wisdom
without imperfection. I saw what no mind can see,
and what no language can express, in this temple. There
were emblems of order, emblems of honor, emblems of
brotherhood, emblems of wisdom, emblems of peace, emblems
of innocence, and emblems of victory.</p>

<p>When my guide saw my mind contemplating these
wonders, he said, “Thou wilt bear with thee the impress
of these emblems on thy mind, and thou wilt see thy
reward in the obedience which will be expected of thee.
Soon thou must go with me. The wail of misery invites
our aid. Thou wilt do thy pleasure.”</p>

<p>T. My pleasure is to do as thou hast said. I will not
refuse thy command.</p>

<p>G. No; as it is thy will.</p>

<p>T. As it is thine also.</p>

<p>“As it is of this circle,” said the Master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Even so, Amen,” responded the High Priest.</p>

<p>“Friends, when ye shall return, bring your friend,
without money and without price.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were works which no mind can comprehend, revolving
around our heads, when we left the arch-way. “I am
not a medical mind,” said my guide, “but do you hear
that groan of distress?”</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“To the house of need, then will we go,” said he.</p>

<p>When we reached the cottage, I saw the mind was
frantic with despair.</p>

<p>G. Yea; and thou seest the cause.</p>

<p>T. Truly, but who shall believe our report?</p>

<p>G. Thou wilt not say, but do as thou canst to aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>This cottage stood near the Thames, and about six
miles from London. The mind of the almost distracted
man, was writhing in the agony of death. The family of
children were weeping beside the mother, who was sitting
at a little distance from the couch, on which the invalid
rested. I saw no other company present. They were
not affluent, but depended upon their industry for subsistence.
Near by, lived a lord of the heritage, who rode
in livery, and fared sumptuously. He was apprised of the
dangerous illness of his servant, and knew the wants of
the dependent family. He came not near, but his wife
sent a few necessaries by another servant, whom we saw
leaving the cottage as we entered.</p>

<p>“There is wretchedness here,” said my companion.</p>

<p>T. Truly; but what can we do to mitigate the evil?</p>

<p>W. We can do what we can, and what we can not do,
will not be our fault. Thou mayest go to the landlord,
and impress his mind to come here speedily.</p>

<p>I went. He was viewing his farm. It was a smiling
season. The luxuriant foliage of nature was never more
picturesque. The wild birds were chanting their melodious
sonnets, and the lowing herds were grazing on the
fertile field. When I approached him, he was meditating
upon the probable income of his estate. I was not without
hope of making an impression favorable to humanity.
I was aided by a near relative of the suffering man. We both
aimed instantaneously our power to make him feel a sympathy
for the distressed. I saw he was impressed with
our wish, and he turned around as if to go to the cottage;
but as he turned, he said to himself, “Why should I go
there; this world is full of misery. There is yonder city;
what could I do to remove the ills of that great metropolis?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
It is the misfortune of some to be poor, and what is their
misfortune is not my fault.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” said my assistant.</p>

<p>“We will still do our duty,” I replied. “If you will
act as you can to impress his mind with sympathy, I will
aid his conscientiousness to go with us.”</p>

<p>“Even so,” said he.</p>

<p>We continued our work till he said, “On one account, I
will go and see him. He has been faithful unto me, in
many things, and I will not now be ungrateful for his
services.” So saying, he went to the cottage. On entering
it, he was met by the wife of the frantic man, who
said:</p>

<p>“Dear man, I am distracted with trouble. My God!
what shall I do? He is insane, and we have to watch
him every moment. Last night he was determined to kill
me. He said we would not receive religion, and God had
commanded him to kill us. Oh! what can we do,” she
cried, piteously.</p>

<p>“I think I would send for the minister,” said he; “it is
not possible he can live long in such a state. Perhaps, he
might afford him relief by preparing his soul for death.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better to get a doctor, my lord?”</p>

<p>“It is of no use to get a physician now; it is too late:
To-morrow will end all his troubles,” replied the landlord.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” sighed the wife; “and I would to God
it might end mine; but here are our dear children; who
will care for them when death has ruined our hopes?”</p>

<p>“Thou hearest that lament,” said my associate.</p>

<p>“I hear. Shall we despair? Never, while human woes
require our aid. Never, until success attend our efforts,”
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>At my suggestion, my associate made a noise, which
attracted the attention of the nobleman, as he was called.
It was made by removing a piece of wrought iron, resembling
a broken knife, which rested over a window.</p>

<p>“What is that?” said he.</p>

<p>The wife, whose name was Mary, said, “I see nothing.”</p>

<p>The same noise was repeated.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that?” said the nobleman.</p>

<p>“Yes; I hear a rattle of the window,” replied Mary.</p>

<p>“That was not the window,” said he.</p>

<p>Stepping to the window, he placed his hand upon it,
and said, “The window is firm, perhaps it was the old
iron.”</p>

<p>When we saw his attention drawn another way, the
sound was again produced.</p>

<p>“It is that iron,” said he; “but what moves it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mary; “it will soon rattle again,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>It was not long before he wished to hear again that
noise. While looking steadily upon it, the iron fell to the
floor. “There,” said he, “I knew it was the iron. I wonder
what done that!” I stood near him, and impressed
his mind with the conviction that spirits wrought such
things. He was impressed, as we could; and, at length,
said he, “if that old iron was not lifeless, I should believe
it could move itself.”</p>

<p>M. Oh, my worthy lord; do not—I shall be afraid
of seeing ghosts, when I am alone.</p>

<p>L. Pshaw; a ghost never made that noise.</p>

<p>M. What then?</p>

<p>It was not more than a second before the iron was uplifted
about a foot, and fell on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Well: who knows what all this can mean?” said he.
“The devil must be amusing himself. I wish he would
come, and heal this dying man.”</p>

<p>“You do not suppose the devil will do good?” said
Mary.</p>

<p>L. No; but, when I was not more than eleven years
old, I recollect my mother said, “a good fountain can not
send forth bitter water, nor a bitter fountain good water.”</p>

<p>When we had aroused his mind on the subject of spirits,
we wished to avail something which would be serviceable
to the mind, writhing in distress. Accordingly, we worked
so as to make a manifestation near the bed. He was now
excited, and verily thought these sounds were premonitions
of some awful visitation of Providence.</p>

<p>L. It may not be doubted that there is some meaning
to these sounds. If I were a believer in witchcraft, I
would say that witches had something to do with these
noises. Perhaps, it will appear that my days are numbered.
If so, will another noise be made?</p>

<p>My associate now responded by a sound, as before. The
nobleman was horror-struck. “The devil is in this,” said
he. “If my days are numbered, will that rattle of the
iron be repeated?”</p>

<p>The rattle was heard again. But gathering a little more
courage, he said, mentally, “a coward is worse than a
traitor. I am an Englishman. Never let it be said, that
an Englishman is afraid of ghosts.” My guide then impressed
his mind to ask, “do you want any thing of me?”</p>

<p>The well known rattle responded.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said he, “it will be well to call the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Rattle, rattle,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Now, there must be intelligence some where to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
these noises,” said he. “I do not know what may be the
result. But do not be alarmed. I will send a man after
my physician, and when he comes back, I will return.
In the mean time, Mary, you may remember that ghosts
never murdered any one. Have you wanted a little tea
and sugar for John? It will not do him harm,—and
you may take this half crown, and get what it will buy.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate man was worse. He had heard what
they had said about his dying. In a half conscious state
of mind, he said, “Mary, what did he want? He need
not be vexed about rent—he will not ask again where
I am.”</p>

<p>“No, no: He wanted to see you, and he gave me this
half crown to get some tea and sugar for you, and besides
he has sent for his doctor—all very kind. He is a kind
man in sickness. It is not every landlord you know, who
would even come to visit a servant in sickness, much less
offer them aid; I hope he will get the doctor, and you
will get around again.”</p>

<p>The little boy was dispatched to a shop, where he bought
a half crown in value of tea and sugar. He returned with
bounding feet, and said; “Mother, Sam ax me where I
got my money to buy tea and sugar.”</p>

<p>“Hush, my child! you will disturb your father. He
must have rest before the doctor comes.”</p>

<p>In about an hour, the landlord and the physician
came. The physician was a profound man in the science
of medicine, and experienced in his profession. He graduated
from the University at Edinburg, in the year 1791.
He received his diploma, and was reputed a successful
practitioner of medicine in the hospital of London, for
many years. As he advanced toward the bedside, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
rather couch of the sufferer, he was met by the wild rolling
eye of the patient. Taking his hand, he said, “He
is somewhat feverish, and there is a degree of inflammation
on the brain. I would recommend mustard, applied
to the feet, and cold, wet cloths to the neck and forehead.
You must not,” said he, “agitate his mind about dying;
for he wearies himself too much now about his prospects.
Let him have some nourishment, as his appetite may
crave, when he is sane; but do not urge him to eat or
drink any thing. It is possible he may not want any
thing, but you will need some one who will aid you to
watch with him to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will send one of his comrades,” said the nobleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Then I will write down the prescription.</p>

<p>L. That will be unnecessary, because he can not read.</p>

<p>D. And can not this woman read?</p>

<p>M. No, sir; my parents were poor, and I was not sent
to school.</p>

<p>“It is important,” said the doctor “that this prescription
be strictly adhered to. The least deviation may prove
fatal to his recovery.”</p>

<p>“I can remember all,” replied Mary.</p>

<p>When the doctor was about to leave, Mary and the nobleman
accompanied him to the yard. She said, “do
you think John will get well, doctor?”</p>

<p>D. It is possible; but the chances are against him.
The brain is very restless, and besides there is a predisposition
to monopolize the entire control of his whole system.
I have never known so aggravated a disease to be
overcome without the greatest care. If he should live till
morning, I will see him again.</p>

<p>M. Would it not be well to ask the curate to pray?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>D. The curate will not aid his recovery, and I would
recommend that he should not visit you till John is better;
but, if you really desire his aid, you will ask him to pray
for your husband at home.</p>

<p>M. Not at home!</p>

<p>D. Yes; at home, God will answer, as here.</p>

<p>The landlord and the physician went away. The evening
was still, and no comrade came to watch with the
suffering patient. The lone night wasted away, until near
two o’clock in the morning, when John was released from
his mortal body, and we received him, as we had been
received.</p>

<p>During the last convulsive throes of agony, his wife besought
God, imploringly, to have mercy on his soul.
Never went up to heaven a more sincere and fervent supplication
for aid, than this dejected and despairing wife
offered for the companion of her youth. Alas! what
wife could do more, when mind is torn from mind, and
no appearance of reuniting again. The whole heart was
given to her husband, and he honored the marriage vow
with a constant integrity, which made even the cottage
to smile with the warm affection of true hearts. “I was
well satisfied,” said she, “with my poverty, with my union
to make me happy; but now, oh, my God! what shall I
do? Oh, dear, what can I do in this unfriendly world?”
Then she sighed, and sighed from the soul; but her sighs
were aggravated by the mournful despondency of her dear
children. She was heard to say: “When my father consented
to our marriage,” he said, “Mary, you must not
think this beautiful world is all sunshine and summer.
There will come clouds of sorrow, nights of gloom, and
days of adversity. You will remember my saying, Mary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
when the winter of bereavement howls its angry blast
around your dwelling, and no voice of kindness gladdens
the solitude of your weary hours. But now you have consented
to marry the man you love; be faithful, even unto
death.”</p>

<p>Such were the silent meditations of a soul, surcharged
with grief, as we witnessed at the cottage of a laborer.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, I saw the body conveyed to the
Potter’s Field, and the wife and children to the alms-house.
During this period, no landlord came near the cottage.
The widow mourned without hope, and the three children
clung to her with unusual affection. The boy who was
the oldest of the children, seemed to realize the calamity.
He said:</p>

<p>“Mother, what shall we do now, my dear father is put
in the ground?”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she replied, “we shall be separated. Oh,
my child, you distress me. You will see your kind father
no more. They have buried him in the cold earth.”</p>

<p>J. Will he never come home again?</p>

<p>M. No; he can not come back here, James.</p>

<p>J. Will he stay there in the earth, mother?</p>

<p>M. His body will stay there, but his spirit will appear
before the bar of God, at the great day of judgment. All
will appear before the throne of God to receive their reward;
so you must be a good boy, James, that you may
go to heaven.</p>

<p>J. Has father gone to heaven?</p>

<p>M. I don’t know, my child; he was not a member of
any church; but he never wronged any body, as I know
of. He will wait till he receives the sentence of God, and
then all will know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>J. How long will he wait, mother?</p>

<p>M. I don’t know, my son.</p>

<p>J. Where will he wait?</p>

<p>M. You must not ask such questions. The Bible does
not tell us any thing about it, and we must not ask for
things which are not revealed.</p>

<p>When two days had passed, the wife and children were
conveyed to the alms house. The overseer said to Mary:</p>

<p>O. Is your father living?</p>

<p>M. No, sir, he has been dead about three years.</p>

<p>O. Did he leave any property?</p>

<p>M. I was not at home when he died, but I heard he
died in the hospital.</p>

<p>O. In what hospital?</p>

<p>M. Well, they called it a hospital, such as they have
in the army. I heard my mother say he was wounded,
and brought home to England, and he never got well
again.</p>

<p>O. At what battle was he wounded?</p>

<p>M. I never knew the place, but it seems to me more
like Waterloo than any other name.</p>

<p>During this investigation, my mind was impressed to
work a reform. I saw the injustice of oppression in all its
naked deformity. The lords of the soil had monopolized
all that could afford subsistence by cultivation, and then
demanded the service of the landless at their own apprisal.
“What better is this,” said I to William, “than chattels
in slavery?”</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see a difference. A voluntary servitude
is willing bondage, but involuntary service is unwilling
subjection to the will of a master. A willing service is the
result of conditions; but an unwilling bondage is the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of cruelty. It is oppression without acquiescence, or
reward for labor, by contract.</p>

<p>Not receiving a clear solution of my inquiry, I asked,
“What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary
slavery.”</p>

<p>W. Voluntary slavery is to do what is required by a
contract. The doer voluntarily assents on condition of
receiving a stipulated compensation. Involuntary slavery
is to do what the mind would not do unless coerced by
compulsory measures. It does not contract to do any
thing, but is forced to do what the master requires.</p>

<p>T. But do not the circumstances of the poor in Europe,
coerce them to contract for service, which other conditions
would not approve?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt remember, Thomas, that other conditions
coerce the master to hire and pay them for their services.
The compulsion is, therefore, mutual, and whatever
is mutual is equitable. But when a mind is compelled
to do service without the assent of the doer, there
is no mutual necessity, nor equity in the arrangement.</p>

<p>T. There is no necessity, I trust, then, which would
justify the misery that results from the oppression of the
poor, in neglecting the means essential for their comfort.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast well judged. Had avarice the wisdom
of truth to control its treasures, the folly of oppression
would find no habitation among men. But what thou
seest is generosity, when compared with the injustice thou
wilt behold in thy pilgrimage.</p>

<p>T. Spare me, then, the sight!</p>

<p>W. Hast thou not a heart to do good? And wilt thou
shrink from its performance, because the sight is unwelcome?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>T. I will not shrink from my duty; for where duty
calls, there is my pleasure, my bliss, my heaven.</p>

<p>W. Then, follow me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> conducted me to a wall. There was no door of entrance.
It was made of scorn. I could see through the
wall, for there were a great many port holes. I saw a
wild circle of minds peeping through these holes, as though
suspicious of our encroachment. When we had passed
around the fortress, I heard the centurion say, “To arms,
to arms.” He was a dark mind. He was told by my
companion, “We are not enemies, but friends.”</p>

<p>C. What hast thou to do here?</p>

<p>W. We have come to aid thee.</p>

<p>C. Hast thou not learned, that we do not admit
strangers within these walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>W. Thou wilt not refuse what we do not ask. We do
not ask admission within such walls, but we seek the deliverance
of thee and thy fellows.</p>

<p>C. Deliverance! Who art thou that profferest deliverance
to the saints under my command?</p>

<p>W. I am thy friend, and the friend of thy companions.</p>

<p>C. How may I know thou art what thou sayest?</p>

<p>W. By my works.</p>

<p>C. Dost thou believe in the Bible?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see my faith by my works.</p>

<p>C. Thy works will not save a mind.</p>

<p>W. What then will save?</p>

<p>C. Believe in the Bible.</p>

<p>W. Will a belief in the Bible save without works?</p>

<p>C. A belief in the Bible will lead to good works, and
faith and good works will save.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast said, believe in the Bible. Will that
belief save?</p>

<p>C. Yes; because it will lead to good works.</p>

<p>W. Does a belief in the Bible lead all who believe to
good works only?</p>

<p>C. Thou art an infidel, and yet thou profferest deliverance
unto the people of God.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not revile when thou obeyest our instruction.</p>

<p>C. But ought not I to call thee by thy true name?</p>

<p>W. Then, thou wouldst not rebuke when it is not thy
prerogative to judge. Dost thou remember the record of
thy confidence—that thou shouldst not judge, lest thou
be judged; for with what measure ye mete unto others,
it shall be meted to you again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>C. I will not agree with thee, that because I have said
thou wast an infidel, therefore I shall be judged as such
before the bar of God.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt then disagree with thy Bible?</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt allow an explanation of that passage, I
suppose?</p>

<p>W. When thou askest me to allow thee to explain, I
want thee to understand, that thy explanation is not mine.
Thou mayest not explain for me; for possibly thy wisdom
may wholly destroy what those, in whom thou believest,
have sought to establish. What thou sayest is thy own,
and what is thy own, thou shouldst not impute to another.
Thou callest us infidels; but we never seek to destroy
another’s property, as thou hast proposed by thy offer to
explain what thou, perchance, hast no authority for doing.
Hast thou read the prohibition?</p>

<p>C. What prohibition?</p>

<p>W. Whosoever addeth unto the sayings of the prophecy
of this book, God will add unto him the plagues
which are written in this book; and whosoever taketh
away the sayings, God will take away his part out of the
book of life. What is thy explanation but adding or
diminishing the record of another?</p>

<p>C. It is all infidelity to talk as thou dost.</p>

<p>W. Thou sayest, then, that the words of the Bible are
infidelity?</p>

<p>C. No; but when thou deniest the instrumentalities
of revelation, thou savorest the cause of infidelity.</p>

<p>W. What instrumentalities does revelation require to
reveal itself?</p>

<p>C. It requires an explanation.</p>

<p>W. Is the explanation a revelation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>C. It is an explanation of dark passages in the Bible.</p>

<p>W. Well, is an explanation of dark passages in the
Bible, a revelation from God?</p>

<p>C. No; but it is essential to mind, in order to be saved.</p>

<p>W. Is that essential to mind which does not agree
with itself, and contradicts what is revealed?</p>

<p>C. A correct explanation is consistent, and does not
contradict itself, or the Bible.</p>

<p>W. But hast thou not contradicted the Bible, and dost
thou not recommend an explanation which expressly takes
away the whole force of a divine prohibition?</p>

<p>C. No; it gives it a different meaning, that is all.</p>

<p>W. True; and that is what thou art forbidden to do.</p>

<p>C. I will not submit my judgment to the control of
infidels. I see that thou wilt persist to aid infidelity.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see what thou hast not yet seen, if thou
wilt listen to the voice which requires obedience. Thou
wilt see thyself as thou never wilt desire to see again.</p>

<p>C. How so? I am not ashamed of the cross of Christ.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not obey.</p>

<p>C. I will obey what is just and reasonable, and wouldst
thou have me do more?</p>

<p>W. Is the Bible just and reasonable?</p>

<p>C. Truly.</p>

<p>W. But thou wilt not obey that.</p>

<p>C. Then, I am not a Christian.</p>

<p>W. Well, hast thou said. But wilt thou not revile,
and wilt thou abide by the instruction of the Bible?</p>

<p>C. I trust my all in that blessed book. When I gave
my heart to God, I resolved to live for his glory.</p>

<p>W. And is it for the glory of God to revile thy brother,
and deny what revelation and thy vows unto the Lord
have made incumbent upon thee to perform?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>C. It is not. But who has reviled? Who has denied
his vows and revelation?</p>

<p>W. Hast thou need to be informed, that no name is
so offensive in thy sight as infidel? And didst thou not
use that word to revile thy brother? Is that for the glory
of God, which injures thyself and those that hear thee?
When thou shalt see thyself, as thy Master seeth thee, then
thou wilt not contradict his instruction. Thou wilt not
dispute with revelation, because thou dost not comprehend,
by reason of thy confinement, the wisdom it discloses.
Wouldst thou evacuate this castle?</p>

<p>C. I would consult my teacher, and exercise my reason.</p>

<p>W. Who is thy teacher, and what is thy reason?</p>

<p>C. That thou mayest explain.</p>

<p>W. Thy teacher will not consent to any interference.</p>

<p>C. Thou mayest explain, and I will counsel with him.</p>

<p>W. Better that thou shouldst call him, and I will converse
with him before thee.</p>

<p>C. The mind soon said, “He is here.”</p>

<p>W. Thy teacher will explain.</p>

<p>T. This castle is the gate to heaven. No man can
gain admission to the sanctuary of wisdom, unless he shall
deny the world, and take up the cross.</p>

<p>W. What world must he deny?</p>

<p>T. He must deny all ungodliness, and all worldly-mindedness,
and pride. He must deny the world of
vanity and pleasure.</p>

<p>W. He must not deny himself pleasure?</p>

<p>T. Yes; he must deny himself the pleasures of sin
for a season, that he may inherit eternal life at the day of
judgment.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not say he must deny himself the
pleasure of good?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>T. No: but minds must deny what will do them much
harm.</p>

<p>W. Will good do minds harm?</p>

<p>T. The good of sin will curse the soul at the day of
judgment.</p>

<p>W. Then, wilt thou inform me, why it would not be
better to call that good, evil?</p>

<p>T. It is good now to the sinner; but when God comes to
make up his jewels, he will separate the chaff from the wheat.</p>

<p>W. Will God gather his jewels together at the judgment
day?</p>

<p>T. They will be gathered from one end of heaven to
the other.</p>

<p>W. What will he do with them, when he has gathered
them together?</p>

<p>T. He will place them at his right hand.</p>

<p>W. Whom will he place on the left hand?</p>

<p>T. The goats.</p>

<p>W. Who are the goats?</p>

<p>T. Infidels and unbelievers.</p>

<p>W. Who are infidels and unbelievers?</p>

<p>T. Those who deny revelation, and disobey God.</p>

<p>W. Then all who deny revelation, and disobey God,
are infidels, or unbelievers?</p>

<p>T. Yes.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou never denied revelation, and disobeyed
God? Thou wilt not reject what revelation discloses and
duty requires, if wisdom be found in thy sayings.</p>

<p>T. I will not say, I have never denied revelation, and
I acknowledge I have disobeyed God; but, I trust, I have
found favor in his sight, by repentance and faith in the
Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>W. Thou mayest find still greater favor, if thou wilt
evacuate this castle, and receive the inspiration of nature.</p>

<p>T. The inspiration of nature! What is the inspiration
of nature?</p>

<p>W. It is what natural things impress on the mind.</p>

<p>T. How can nature inspire?</p>

<p>W. How can that which is not nature inspire? Hast
thou need of what is not nature? When thou askest,
how can nature inspire? dost thou not know that mind
is nature, and as mind is nature, so nature inspires.</p>

<p>T. Then what is spirit but nature?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt answer, “what is not wisdom is nature.”</p>

<p>T. Truly. That which has no wisdom is nature, and
that which has wisdom is spirit.</p>

<p>W. Have thy words a spirit?</p>

<p>T. They are the productions of a spirit.</p>

<p>W. Is not nature the production of a spirit?</p>

<p>T. Yea; and so are all things.</p>

<p>W. Then, if all things be the production of a spirit,
nature is the production of a spirit, and, if nature be the
production of a spirit, thou seest nature unites to show
what the spirit has done. It is the work of the spirit,
and what is the work of a spirit is a revelation of its wisdom.
Thou seest that the work must reveal the character
and skill of the workman. That development, revealed
by the work, is the inspiration of nature. It is the voice
of God, which inspires his creatures with veneration.</p>

<p>T. But what wilt thou say of the Bible?</p>

<p>W. I will say, it is the production of nature’s works.
It is the production of spirit, which is manifested in nature.
It is what thou seest, the work of mind developed, or revealed,
as mind needed. It is not as thou seest in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
things. Thou seest as thy mind hast been instructed, and
thou hast been instructed by others not wiser than thyself.</p>

<p>T. But is not the Bible the standard of all truth?</p>

<p>W. It is the standard only of its own truth.</p>

<p>T. Must not all other revelation yield to its authority,
when contradictory statements appear?</p>

<p>W. Contradictions of nature are not a part of revelation.
That which contradicts nature, is not revelation;
because nature is a revelation of the wisdom of God. When
thou readest thy Bible, dost thou see a contradiction?</p>

<p>T. I have not found any contradiction of my faith.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou found any contradiction of thy practice?</p>

<p>T. I will not answer thy question.</p>

<p>W. Is it not important to practice our faith?</p>

<p>T. It is.</p>

<p>W. Why, then, dost thou refuse to answer my question?</p>

<p>T. Because I will not.</p>

<p>W. But why will you not?</p>

<p>T. Then, thou wouldst claim an exception to my cause.</p>

<p>W. I claim only consistency.</p>

<p>T. Am I inconsistent?</p>

<p>W. When thou wilt answer as thou knowest, thou art
consistent; but when thou seest not what is true, thou
mayest be inconsistent with truth. Thou wilt not say
thou art consistent in all things.</p>

<p>T. Who art thou?</p>

<p>W. I am thy friend.</p>

<p>T. How may I know thee to be my friend?</p>

<p>W. Thou mayest know, when thou shalt disabuse thyself
of thy errors. Thou wilt not accuse thy friend, before
thou hast seen aught against him.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt prove what thou hast said. I will not receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
a doctrine, until I see what evidence it has for its
support.</p>

<p>W. Very well. Hast thou observed thy rule in the
formation of thy opinions? Hast thou evidence that thy
opinions of the Bible are all true? What evidence hast
thou, that stolen waters are sweet, and that there is pleasure
in sin? I want all the evidence thou hast to prove that
there is any pleasure in doing wrong.</p>

<p>T. Why, you astonish me: The wicked man is not
troubled as is the righteous. He will not need to suffer
persecution for the cause of religion, and he will take his
ease and comfort in sin without reforming. He is as a
tree planted by waters, and he takes his fill of iniquity.
He fares sumptuously every day; while the devoted Christian
has many trials and crosses to endure, and is troubled
about his everlasting condition. Morning and evening, he
invokes the blessing of God upon his soul.</p>

<p>W. Canst thou tell me, why nature wrongs the righteous?
or by what law a wrong mind is made happy, while
a right mind suffers so much?</p>

<p>T. The law of God will show thee.</p>

<p>W. Show me what?</p>

<p>T. Show thee that God suffers a great many evils to
attend his children, that they may realize the greatness of
his mercy and salvation.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not answer.</p>

<p>T. I say, that God does not afflict the wicked as he
does the righteous.</p>

<p>W. For what reason, and by what law, is this injustice
continued?</p>

<p>T. By the law of God, of course.</p>

<p>W. Is that law eternal?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>W. Then, why will not the righteous, as thou callest
thyself, eternally suffer, and the wicked escape their
wretchedness?</p>

<p>T. That is infidelity. We must make the Bible our
standard.</p>

<p>W. Wilt thou say, the Bible contradicts reason?</p>

<p>T. Reason is carnal.</p>

<p>W. How dost thou know?</p>

<p>T. Because the Bible says so.</p>

<p>W. Wilt thou read it for my instruction?</p>

<p>T. I will say, that is the meaning of the passage.</p>

<p>W. How do you know?</p>

<p>T. How do I know any thing?</p>

<p>W. By thy reason.</p>

<p>T. Well, my reason tells me, that is the meaning.</p>

<p>W. Dost thou presume to use carnal reason to interpret
the Bible, so as to favor thy views?</p>

<p>T. My reason is not carnal; I have been regenerated
by the atonement of Christ.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not receive a doctrine without evidence,
and dost thou require of me what thou art unwilling to do
thyself? How may I know thy reason is any better than
mine? How may I know that thou hast spoken only
what the living spirit intended by that passage?</p>

<p>T. I see thou wilt cavil with the word of God.</p>

<p>W. Not with the word of God, friend; but with thy
saying. How may I know thou art correct?</p>

<p>T. Have I not said, by the standard of the Bible.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast said well; but thou askest another
standard, which is thy interpretation by thy reason.</p>

<p>T. Wouldst thou, then, have me lay aside my reason?</p>

<p>W. No; but I would have thee exercise it; and, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
thou offerest thy Bible as the standard, not again offer thy
interpretations as a substitute. Besides, thou hast offered
a doctrine to thy friend, which is contrary to thy standard.</p>

<p>T. How so?</p>

<p>W. In that thou sayest, there is pleasure in sin. Hast
not thou read in thy Bible, that the wicked are like the
troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt; and that
there is no peace to them? How sayest thou, then, that
the Bible is the standard, and that there is pleasure in sin?
How sayest thou, that the good of sin will curse the soul
at the day of judgment, when thy Bible tells thee that
there is no good in sin, for the way of the transgressor is
hard? Thou wilt not say, we are enemies of the Bible,
because we justify its sayings in opposition to thy interpretations.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not satisfy me, that the wicked are
troubled as other men are.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not, then, be satisfied with thy standard?</p>

<p>T. Yes; but thou wilt take it altogether, and not in
parts.</p>

<p>W. Take it as thou wilt, only take it as it is, without
thy interpretation superadded.</p>

<p>T. Why wouldst thou deny interpretation?</p>

<p>W. That is what has made thy castle. That is what
has sown dissension among brethren. That is what has
filled the earth with bloodshed and strife. That is what
has set mind against mind, and embittered soul against
soul. That is what makes hirelings of men, who would
interpret what is already revealed, and wrongs the uninformed
of the knowledge of God and heaven. That is
what divides and distracts whole communities and nations,
and makes war upon the rights of mind to investigate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
truth, and aid thy fellow servants to do what nature and
reason imperatively demand.</p>

<p>The castle was then abandoned by us for a season. “In
wisdom,” said my companion, “are all things made, which
are in heaven, and which are on earth.”</p>

<p>“But who is wise to understand the wisdom of that
castle?” I replied.</p>

<p>W. Thou knowest that contentment is peace. Thou
knowest that minds are contented with that which satisfies.
When thou wast in darkness, as thou seest thy brethren,
when thou hadst no desire to be instructed only to confirm
thy own cause, thou didst not wish thyself contradicted
by any wisdom disagreeing with thy own.</p>

<p>T. When I was instructed, I was not as they are.</p>

<p>W. True. Thou wast as they are before thou wast
instructed. When thou didst see the error of thy ways,
thou didst forsake them. But thy brethren do not yet
see. They see some things, but there is a veil over their
eyes. They see a castle, and they see the things in that
castle; but they do not see the things which are not
within it.</p>

<p>T. They would see more, were it not for the walls
which enclose them.</p>

<p>W. The walls which enclose them, are of their own
creation. The elevated spirit never walls itself in by a
work of mind. Those walls are not of jasper, but of self-conceit.
They are the works of ignorance. When minds
indulge the idea, that they know all that is worth possessing,
when they flatter themselves that they are wiser
than every other mind, is it strange that they should fortify
themselves against all invasion of their conceited infallibility?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>T. But, when we go to instruct them, it surprises me,
that they should resist the facts which are presented to
them.</p>

<p>W. It would not surprise thee, peradventure, if thou
shouldst inspect more cautiously the influences which operate
with them to overcome the truth. Suppose we rise
above the wall, and see from above the machinery employed
to keep their position secure.</p>

<p>We arose and saw the interior of the castle. “There,”
said my guide, “now thou canst judge for thyself. What
thou seest, thou hast no need that I tell thee.”</p>

<p>I saw a cloud of witnesses beheaded<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> for the sake of
religion. I saw a mind declaiming against cruelty, yet
urging his companions to fight the battle, as long as life
was spared. “Those who oppose us,” said he “are enemies
of God, and in league with the devil. They must be
overcome, or our religion will be destroyed. Better that
all who are not of us be slain, than that the cause of religion
should be swept away. These heretics should not
be allowed to corrupt the minds of the people of God, and
the people of God will not allow them to do it without
resistance even unto death.” When he had concluded
his harangue, the Teacher, who had received instruction
through the port hole, said, he had just had an interview
with a heretic. The heretic had informed him, that no
intrusion was contemplated; but he insisted that the people
of God contradicted the Bible in their practice. He
said that we interpreted the Bible contrary to its express
prohibition. I do not agree with all he said, but what to
do with his argument, I am not prepared to say. Perhaps
the circle can explain the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>M. This circle will not undertake to explain the objections
of infidels. It is sufficient for the circle to resist the
works of the devil, and keep itself pure from the heresies,
which endanger the salvation of the soul. The circle
should warn evil minds of the danger which awaits them,
if they do not repent, and get religion; and I can see no
way to do it, more effectually, than to treat them with
silent contempt.</p>

<p>T. Ought not the circle to obey the Scriptures?</p>

<p>M. They ought to do their duty, and that duty is
made plain by its own covenant obligations.</p>

<p>T. How can our covenant obligations contradict the
Scriptures?</p>

<p>M. They do not.</p>

<p>T. How do we fulfil our covenant obligations, unless
we meet the arguments of heretics?</p>

<p>M. Who has made you a heretic?</p>

<p>T. I wish to know what should be done, when heretics
offer the Bible against our views. I am not a heretic.</p>

<p>M. But you recognize their doctrine, else, why ask
about our covenant obligations with heretics?</p>

<p>T. I suppose we ought to do something to meet their
objections.</p>

<p>M. Well, the way to meet them is not to reply to them.</p>

<p>T. That will not do them any good. They will soon
say we are afraid of them.</p>

<p>M. They will say any thing to encourage infidelity.</p>

<p>T. They will quote Scripture to oppose us.</p>

<p>M. Yes, and so will the devil.</p>

<p>T. Then what must be done?</p>

<p>M. Have I not told you—do nothing—say nothing?</p>

<p>T. Will that remove the wrong of their opposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>M. The wrong is of their own choice.</p>

<p>T. Is not the right also?</p>

<p>M. That is a heretical notion. I see you have suffered
already from your conversation with them.</p>

<p>T. How have I suffered?</p>

<p>M. Why, you would encourage the doctrine of fatalism.
Mind is a free agent. When you make the religion
of the circle a choice, you would do away with the cross.
That is no cross, which you choose.</p>

<p>T. The unconverted will oppose. Is not that bearing
the cross?</p>

<p>M. It is; but you know that no mind would choose
religion—I will say that no mind would choose a religion
under such disadvantages, unless for the crown it will receive
when God judges the world. The sceptic will not
receive religion, and he must reap his reward.</p>

<p>The mind was so incensed against heretics, that my
guide said, “Is it a wonder that they reject the truth?
There is another wheel to this machinery.”</p>

<p>“What wheel?” said I.</p>

<p>“It is a wheel which moves all other wheels,” replied
William. He soon took me to a secret place. “There,”
said he, “do you hear the sound of something falling on
that wheel?” I saw, and heard the sound. It seemed to
me like gold and silver. I heard a mind say to its comrade,
“suppose the gold and silver should cease to fall on
that wheel, do you think it would move?”</p>

<p>“The wheel,” replied he, “must have weight, or it
would cease to revolve; and when that wheel stops, all
the rest must stop, for they depend on its motion.”</p>

<p>“What,” said I, “do you call that main wheel, William?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>W. I call it the wheel of Ruin. I might call it a
wheel of Fortune, or rather, as thou wouldst say, the wheel
of misfortune; for what is the gain of one, is the loss of
the other. There is gain thrown on to the wheel from the
current of popularity, but it does not return again to the
owner. He will never receive what he has given to the
devouring cupidity of the main wheel of all the machinery
in this dismal castle. Thou wilt see, that when the weight
is withheld, the wheel will assume its just balance, and
there remain. When the wheel stops, all the dependent
wheels will stop. Therefore, the weights are the moving
power of the whole machinery of this castle.</p>

<p>T. Is it not right to remove these weights?</p>

<p>W. These weights will follow the current into which
they have been thrown; but when the current is changed,
the bark on which they ride will change also its direction.</p>

<p>T. Then, where will the inhabitants of this castle go?</p>

<p>W. They will go where they please, and be free.</p>

<p>T. Would not the freedom of light and love be abused
by their emancipation? Would they not run into all
manner of excess and crime, if restraint were removed?</p>

<p>W. Thou knowest thy experience. When thou wast
admitted into the circle of light and love, didst thou run
into excess because of thy freedom? I perceive thou art
now even more ready and willing to do thy duty, than
when thou wast entangled with the yoke of bondage.</p>

<p>T. Why not, then, summon our companions, and
change the channel of that current, which moves the whole
machinery.</p>

<p>W. The summons is what will create more opposition.
Dost thou not know, that resistance will not overcome resistance.
When mind controls mind, other means must
be employed than force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>T. That I understand; but when a work is required,
workmen are necessary. Wouldst thou not employ workmen
to do a good work?</p>

<p>W. I would not employ workmen to do what was not
wanted. Thou seest that these minds do not desire a
work, which you propose by the summons.</p>

<p>T. They would be grateful, when they saw the work
done.</p>

<p>W. They would not let the work be done.</p>

<p>T. Why not?</p>

<p>W. Because they do not see the benefit thereof.</p>

<p>T. Then, may not our companions aid them to see
the benefit?</p>

<p>W. Yea; and, when all things are ready, they will not
need a summons.</p>

<p>T. Then, who shall get what is lacking in readiness?</p>

<p>W. Time will work what is necessary.</p>

<p>T. That is now.</p>

<p>W. That is ever.</p>

<p>T. When is ever?</p>

<p>W. Ever is now, and hereafter.</p>

<p>T. Then now and hereafter, all things will be in readiness.</p>

<p>W. Yea; and when all things are in readiness, the
work will be completed. Thou mayest now, and ever,
remember, that when thou shalt visit this castle, no mind
will aid thee in what will change the power which controls
the main wheel. It will not change itself, because it desires
no change. It will not allow others to change it, for
the same reason. Thou wilt see the reason. The love of
silver and gold is more powerful than thy arguments, or
thy reason. The wheel will go with its load to aid, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
it is worn out, and there is no material to build another.
When the time comes, and come it will, that the wheel is
worn out, and the channel drained, because the fountain
is exhausted, the work will be completed, and the walls of
this castle will not remain.</p>

<p>T. The wretchedness of this bondage must remain,
then, until time shall work into disuse the materials of which
it is composed. I could hope that day not distant.</p>

<p>W. Thou mayest well hope. The wheel will not be
repaired again. There is no material which can be worked
into use. The body is not sound, and the branches are
withered. The whole heart is sick, and the wheel will not
run, when the current is dry, because no fountain remains
to supply it.</p>

<p>T. Of what use, then, are efforts to destroy these
walls, or change the current which propels the machinery?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not suppose proper efforts unavailing, because
thy resistance is unsuccessful. There is a distinction
between proper and improper means, which may be employed
for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>T. What can be more proper, than such means as will
control the main wheel?</p>

<p>W. The main wheel is well, as it is. The control of
that wheel is not what we seek, but the minds who manage
the wheel as it is turned. Thou wilt not wish the
wheel ill, but the minds who are controlled by it, good.</p>

<p>T. If the wheel control the minds, dwelling in this
castle, how can those minds be controlled without controlling
that which controls them?</p>

<p>W. The wheel revolves by weight of other influences.
When those influences shall have no weight, the wheel
will not move, because it will want power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>T. Then thou wouldst overcome the weight on the
wheel. How can weight be less than weight, without a
suspension of the law of gravitation?</p>

<p>W. The attraction of all bodies depends upon the
relation which they have to each other. Affinities are
attracted to each other by a mutual correspondence. Two
bodies will unite when they correspond, by the law of mutual
affinity. Unlike bodies resist each other. Fire, being
unlike water, will not unite in harmony. They are not
attracted to each other. Oil and water will not mingle.
Pain and pleasure are separate. When, therefore, thou
wouldst overcome the gravity of gold and silver on the
wheel, thou hast only to control the love of minds, so that
the affinity will be overcome. Destroy the love of gold
and silver, and the weight is nothing on the wheel of motion.
Destroy the motion, and the whole machinery stops.</p>

<p>T. When the motion stops, what will the minds do?
Are they to remain without employ?</p>

<p>W. When the wheel is not controlled by the love of
money, the wheel will move by other weights, so that
indolence will not be a guest.</p>

<p>T. What other influences can control?</p>

<p>W. The weight of fear and favor. The fear of wrath
and the hope of deliverance will move the wheel. But
the motion will be tremulous and unsteady. Thou hast
seen by the words of the centurion and his teacher, that
the power is given by fear and hope. Thou wilt see that
when minds are moved by these weights, selfishness is
consulted. The love of self moves the mind to seek what
will avert wrath, and secure favor. It is not the love of
goodness which controls the minds of this circle, but the
fear of evil. The fear of evil is not goodness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>T. Are not fear and hope essential to minds in this castle,
in order to keep them from outbreaking sins?</p>

<p>W. The fear and hope of these minds, are what make
them slaves. Their master understands the uses which
such motives exert over his servants. Thou wilt see what
will astonish thee; and, when thou seest, thou wilt not
rejoice, but mourn.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not rejoice, but mourn! What will
make me mourn?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see, shortly.</p>

<p>When we had considered the motives of those who occupied
this castle, we next proceeded to a secret work,
which was concealed near a large mansion, surrounded
with an armed force of minds, ready to execute the mandates
of the occupant.</p>

<p>“This is the king’s palace,” said William.</p>

<p>T. But what king needs such an armed force? Is he
a tyrant that he requires aid to protect him from harm?</p>

<p>W. He is not without fear and hope. He fears what
the minds may do whom he rules, and he hopes by an
armed force to coerce minds into submission to his authority.</p>

<p>T. On what ground does he base such a conclusion?</p>

<p>W. On the ground that other minds are as he is. He
knows his own mind is controlled by fear and hope, and
he believes others should be. When he judges others, it
is by himself. What affects him most powerfully, he supposes
will affect his subjects.</p>

<p>T. Is not that a correct rule?</p>

<p>W. It is correct when both conditions are alike; and it
is incorrect when otherwise.</p>

<p>T. Are not all minds controlled by like motives?</p>

<p>W. Assuredly not. Thou knowest that thy mind is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
not controlled by gold and silver, or hope and fear. When
thou seest a mind controlled by such wheels, thou wilt
understand, that they are servants to the master whose
control they obey. Therefore, thou seest that what controls
others, will have no power over thee. The king errs
in supposing that all his subjects are even as he is. The
mistake will work the ruin of this castle. When higher
motives control the mind, a higher enjoyment will inspire it.</p>

<p>T. I admit, that all circles of mind are not controlled
by the same motives, or objects; but, when circles of mind
are controlled by hope and fear, ought not hope and fear
to be prominently set before them, so as to induce restraint
upon serious evils?</p>

<p>W. What ought to be, should be; and what should
be, thou shouldst not resist. When mind is controlled by
unworthy motives, when selfish considerations induce obedience,
slaves can control slaves, and tyrants control tyrants;
for, verily, no despotism is more humiliating, and no servitude
more severe, than the drudgery of a mind compelled
to do service, which is burdensome and oppressive, and
in which it has no pleasure or delight. Minds ought to
be controlled by wisdom, which seeks the good because it
is good. They ought to fear no evil in doing what will
make themselves and others happy.</p>

<p>T. That is very true; but, when circles are in a condition
which will not appreciate the high motives thou
hast presented, ought they not to be controlled by hope
and fear, lest they fall into grievous wrong?</p>

<p>W. The hope and fear of their condition will not overcome
what is important. They are not as thou wouldst
have them, nor will hope and fear change their condition.
Two wrongs will not make right. The wrong of ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
can not be remedied by ignorance. The king fears his subjects,
and his subjects fear him. Both are controlled by
fear; but their fears do neither party any good. The
king hopes submission to his commands, and his subjects
hope his commands may not be burdensome. What are
hope and fear, then, but motives of selfishness? The king
is selfish in requiring submission, and his subjects are selfish
in hoping for greater leniency, and less oppressive burdens.
They are alike. Both conditions are equal in the scale of
wisdom. Thou knowest, Thomas, that no such motives
control the infinite Mind. Thou knowest that his gifts
are bestowed upon minds, not because he fears or hopes
any thing to be taken from, or added to, his happiness.
Thou knowest that wisdom, which comes from that Being,
must agree with the character of its cause; and thou knowest
that all wisdom, which does not seek, without hope or
fear, the good of mind, is not of God, but is selfish and
wrong. By this rule, thou wilt do thy duty to the needy,
not because thou fearest or hopest a compensation for thy
service, or thy neglect, but because the needy demand thy
aid. When thy aid is not needed, thou canst go on thy
way, but when thou seest the mind of thy brother in the
bondage of hope and fear, be not angry with him, but
take him in thy charge, and open his eyes to see the gifts
of God distributed without money and without price; so
that his mind may be inspired with the wisdom of the
free, and not with the fear of the slave.</p>

<p>T. Thy words are sweeter than honey in the honey-comb,
and the law, which thou wouldst recommend is the law
of love, uniting the powerful and the weak, the wise and
the unwise, the free and the bondman, in one great family
of minds, each serving the other and doing what will promote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the happiness of the whole without diminishing the
enjoyment of any. But minds often act as slaves, who
dread the lash of a tyrant. They are submissive, because
they are afraid to be otherwise. They wish to do otherwise,
but are restrained, as are slaves, through fear. They
work in hope, not of doing good, but of receiving what
the king has promised. The wisdom of God controls no
desire of their minds. Nothing but selfishness vitalizes
their minds for active employment.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast not said untruly. The king and his
subjects are controlled by the same principle. They are
of selfishness. The king loves what he wants, and loves
it so well that he denies his subjects even a morsel of his
control. However much they may thirst for his power,
he loves himself so much better than he does them, that
he is constrained to refuse them what he enjoys. This
refusal is resistance of others’ wish, and when their wish is
disregarded, when his subjects are denied what they need,
it is no wonder that kings tremble. They know that the
power of many, enlisted in a just cause, is stronger than
the few, in an unjust oppression. Hence, they tremble
with fear, and feel compelled, through fear, to control by
force what they can not by reason. They are in a state of
suspense every moment, not knowing whose head may be
required, nor whose castle may be assaulted by secret
works of ruin in their midst.</p>

<p>The mind wondered, when we surveyed the interior of
the king’s palace. There were the earnings of the poor,
and the industry of millions, profusely lavished in every
apartment. Gold and silver were worked into almost all
the furniture, and the tables were literally covered with
riches of wonderful magnificence. “All for what?”
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Because he is king,” responded William.</p>

<p>“Because he is a tyrant,” I replied.</p>

<p>W. Why must he be a tyrant?</p>

<p>T. Because he suffers the poor to go naked, and the
hungry to starve.</p>

<p>W. Is that tyranny?</p>

<p>T. That is oppression, and oppression is tyranny.</p>

<p>W. The tyrant will answer thee, and say, thou receivest
thy wages, and, when thou askest more, thou art oppressive.</p>

<p>T. But he will not say, the wages are equal to the
necessity?</p>

<p>W. No: but he will say thou didst consent to work
for what thou hast agreed; and when thou askest more
for thy service than what he stipulated to pay thee, thou
art oppressive in thy demands.</p>

<p>T. He will not say, that he is not oppressive when he
controls the price of labor, and makes his servants work
for a consideration inadequate to supply their wants?</p>

<p>W. No: but he will say, their misfortune is not his
fault.</p>

<p>T. Then he will not utter a truth. The misfortune
of one is the fault of many, and most wrongs are the fault
of all.</p>

<p>W. True. And when the king can see that his luxury
is others’ poverty, and others’ poverty a wrong for which
he is responsible, he will not be a king, but only an equal.
The wilderness shall blossom, and the fig tree shall bear
much fruit, when the mind of the king shall be converted
to the clear sunlight of glory, that shines on the outer
walls of this castle.</p>

<p>T. I would that the sun might illumine other minds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
now abiding in the gloom of despair. The morning
light has scarcely dawned on these terraces. The wail of
woe reverberates along the cold walls of scorn, and the
moaning night-breeze bewails the sorrows, which rise
where the sins of wrong grieve the oppressed of millions.
I have wondered why nature has omitted the conversion
of the deluded, who pine in weariness over the misery to
which they are subject.</p>

<p>W. When nature is not perverted, and minds are not
corroded by the abominations of mythological opinions, no
conversion from sin will be necessary. It is not the wrongs
of nature, but the ignorance of nature, which makes conversion
indispensable to higher enjoyment. Thou seest
what wretchedness pervades the minds of these self-righteous
converts to the ignorance of other days. Thou seest,
that they are not content to work without reward. They
have no love of righteousness; no real sympathy for each
other’s woes; no melting compassion for the unfortunate;
no soul to do any thing, unless a golden crown of reward
is set before them. It is not a very great virtue to love
self, or what will contribute only to selfish enjoyment.
When mind loves self, it loves what will do self good.
Brutes may do even more than this. They love their
young. But mind, which works for self alone, is not active
without a prospect of success in its object. The wheel
is moved by a hope of gain, or fear of loss; and all minds,
controlled by such unworthy motives, must be converted,
before they can be wise in the wisdom of God. They
must receive an illumination of their minds by the light
of nature, unfolding wisdom to the immortal soul. Such,
therefore, as thou seest in this castle, who are moved only
to aid the needy by hope and fear, to do what God and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
humanity require, because of rewards, are within a wall
of ignorance and wretchedness, which demand the active
energy of the more devoted to deliver them. Thou seest
the king’s heart. Thou seest he is deceived. He believes
not the truth. He professes the greatest veneration for
God, and the utmost confidence for revelation; and yet
he will not believe the revelation which we have found,
though corroborated by the natural law of progress. His
mind is walled in the fortress of self security. He has
built a gallows to terrify others like himself, so that they
may fear and tremble before him. Thou seest what will
save his mind from the conceit of his perverted imagination.</p>

<p>T. I see he needs to be converted.</p>

<p>W. Then what needs to be done, go thou and do.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt go likewise.</p>

<p>W. That thou knowest.</p>

<p>T. That will not work his conversion, without other
aid.</p>

<p>W. Other aid will come, when required. Thou knowest
thy companions are waiting at the gate of the temple,
to catch the signal. Lift up thy banner, and let the
castle walls now bear the words, which will wave in the
breeze.</p>

<p>I mounted the walls, and the white flag of peace streamed
in the breeze. By my side, stood the angel of light, and
near me the angel of truth. As the signal waved in mystery
to the inhabitants of the castle, the workmen from
the temple came straightway to the banner, and commenced
a new song. They brought with them their implements
of industry, and their harps, and an instrument
of ten strings. They formed a circle on the wall, enclosing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the wisdom of the king and his subjects. When the
circle was formed, the Grand Master said: “Thou mayest
now work; for these stones, which appear so uncomely
and unworthy, may be shapen to the condition, which will
not mar the temple of God. In thy work, see that thou
take nothing for thy labor, and remove nothing which is
valuable, from the possession of those on whom thy labor
shall be bestowed. Take off the roughness of the surface,
and, when thy work is done, bring the work to one who
will inspect thy skill, and he will bid thee go on thy way
rejoicing; for that which was lost is found, and that which
was cast away is returned. Then strike the cymbal, and
let a new song awake the slumbering, for the waste places
shall rejoice, and the thirsty land shall be inspired with the
refreshing rain.”</p>

<p>The circle united in a new song, which fell sweetly on
the air, and floated on the breeze, like music which none
but angels sing. It was soft and sweet, and the gathering
minds wondered at the sound.</p>

<p>When we had sung the song, a mind advanced from the
castle, and said, “Whence comest this music?”</p>

<p>“From the choir, whose banner waves over thy head,”
said William.</p>

<p>M. Art thou a friend, and yet thou dost sing a song?
Why dost thou sing, when thy mother taught thee that
worship was not in song, but in spirit?</p>

<p>W. What my mother said, I do not condemn; but
thou must know, that when we sing, we make melody in
our hearts; and when we make melody in our hearts, we
sing in spirit and truth.</p>

<p>M. But when thou didst worship in thy body, as thy
companions would have thee, thou wouldst not sing; neither
wouldst thou follow a banner as thou dost now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>W. Thou wilt not complain, when thou seest a reform
in my customs. I was not what I now am. When I saw
my error, I was willing to forsake it. Wilt thou do likewise?</p>

<p>M. I am not in favor of new things, till I have tried
them.</p>

<p>W. Art thou willing to try them?</p>

<p>M. I am willing, when I can see and know their utility.</p>

<p>W. How canst thou know the utility of a thing, till
thou receivest it? when thou wilt know, thou must know
for thyself; and when thou wilt know for thyself, thou
must take to thyself what thou desirest to know, so
that thy experience may teach thee the utility of what
thou hast received.</p>

<p>M. Am I not permitted to receive the experience of
another?</p>

<p>W. When thou wilt receive the experience of thy
friends, thou wilt not have thy own experience. Beside,
thou knowest that the experience of thy friends differs.
How canst thou decide the difference without thy own
experience? When I was in the body, I had not experience
in music. Wouldst thou have considered me a competent
judge of that which I knew nothing about, by my
own experience?</p>

<p>M. I would not receive a wrong to add to my experience.</p>

<p>W. When thou condemnest what thou dost not know,
art thou justified in thy condemnation?</p>

<p>M. Not unless it be just.</p>

<p>W. How wilt thou decide what is just without knowledge?</p>

<p>M. How can I decide any thing?</p>

<p>W. By your knowledge of right and wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>M. Well, my knowledge decides that mind should be
consistent with itself.</p>

<p>W. Is that agreeably to thy experience?</p>

<p>M. It is.</p>

<p>W. Then thy consistency is inconsistency.</p>

<p>M. How so?</p>

<p>W. Thou hast done wrong in thy life?</p>

<p>M. Yea.</p>

<p>W. Then consistency will not change thy wrong. Consistency
is agreement; and when thou sayest, I have done
wrong, it is inconsistent with wrong to do right. Consistency
is to do wrong, because wrong has been done. Wouldst
thou recommend consistency with wrong?</p>

<p>M. Nay; but I do not like inconsistency.</p>

<p>W. Inconsistency with what?</p>

<p>M. I do not like a mind that is constantly changing.
I know not where to find a mind that is blown about by
every wind that blows.</p>

<p>W. The wind bloweth where it listeth; thou hearest
the sound thereof, but canst thou tell whence it cometh,
or whither it goeth?</p>

<p>M. I see not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</p>

<p>W. Suppose thou art informed that it cometh from
the east, when it cometh from the west, would thy information
be consistent with thy experience?</p>

<p>M. Nay.</p>

<p>W. When thou asketh me what my mother told me,
what was thy object?</p>

<p>M. Thy mother told thee what was not wrong.</p>

<p>W. Verily, it was not wrong to her understanding.
But my mother will not say, it is right for her, or me, to
refuse to sing, now we have experienced the satisfaction it
adds to our minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>M. Then, thou hast changed thy mind?</p>

<p>W. No; <i>I</i> have not changed my mind, but my <i>experience</i>
has changed it. The music which I hear, is a song
that I love, and what I love, thou wouldst not refuse, when
no mind would be injured by it.</p>

<p>M. But suppose all were to change their minds, and
do as thou hast done, what would the world come to?</p>

<p>W. It would come to a wisdom, which thou deniest
thyself. It would come to a freedom, which would destroy
this castle. It would come to a joy, which would destroy
the wretchedness of thy condition.</p>

<p>M. My condition wretched!</p>

<p>W. Thy condition is wretched.</p>

<p>M. How knowest thou that my condition is wretched?</p>

<p>W. By my experience.</p>

<p>M. Wast thou ever within these walls?</p>

<p>W. Truly.</p>

<p>M. When?</p>

<p>W. When I was as thou art. Thou wilt know what
walls I have recommended, when thou inquirest why I
sought to wear my wide brim, and my drab coat without
buttons, as thou seest others. Thou wilt understand, that
pure and undefiled wisdom does not consist in what thou
sayest, or what thou wearest, but in works of good to the
needy. I was what I was, but what I once was, that I
am not.</p>

<p>M. Would it not have been better for thee than thy
change?</p>

<p>W. Had it not been for the change, I would have been
now as thou art; but I saw an error, and I forsook it.
Wouldst thou have me do otherwise?</p>

<p>M. Nay; but art thou sure now thou art right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>W. I am sure I am not wrong.</p>

<p>M. How so?</p>

<p>W. Because I am more free, more happy, and less in
bondage.</p>

<p>M. Thou talkest strange things. When wast thou in
bondage?</p>

<p>W. When I sought righteousness, because of hope
and fear.</p>

<p>M. That is not bondage.</p>

<p>W. What, then, is bondage?</p>

<p>M. Subjection to the will of another, who is master
over thee.</p>

<p>W. That is right. Thou wilt see I was subject to the
control of hope and fear. I was subject to my master,
who said, “Do this, or not do that,” and who told me
what he would do to me, if I disobeyed. Minds are now
serving many masters in this castle, through fear of their
displeasure.</p>

<p>M. Minds, in this castle, serve many masters? Whom
do we serve, but God?</p>

<p>W. Thou servest whomsoever thou obeyest.</p>

<p>M. True: but no mind can serve two masters.</p>

<p>W. Thou shouldst have said, except he hate the one
and love the other. When thou doest right, whom dost
thou serve?</p>

<p>M. Thou knowest, when a mind does right, it serves
God.</p>

<p>W. When thou doest wrong, whom dost thou serve?</p>

<p>M. The devil.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast done good.</p>

<p>M. I trust I have.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou done evil?</p>

<p>M. Alas! Thou knowest, all have sinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>W. Then, when thou hast done good, thou hast served
God, and when thou hast done evil, thou sayest, thou hast
served the devil. Are there not two masters whom thou
hast served?</p>

<p>M. Thou wilt have it so.</p>

<p>W. And thou wouldst not have me take thy word
with distrust?</p>

<p>M. I would not serve two masters.</p>

<p>W. But thou hast, and what thou hast done, others
may do. When thou servest God, good cometh unto thee,
but when thou doest wrong, evil is in thy path. No mind
serveth God without good, and no mind doeth wrong without
evil. The service of God is good, because it consists
in doing good to thyself, or others; but the service of the
devil is evil, because it consists in doing evil to thyself,
or others.</p>

<p>M. But when I do good, evil is present with me.</p>

<p>W. When thou doest good, because thou lovest the
good of others as thyself, evil will depart from thee, and
thy soul will not mourn. But when thou doest good,
because thou wouldst please thyself by receiving the money
with interest in return, thou mayest well say, “evil is
present with me.”</p>

<p>M. Thou knowest that thy reproof will apply to an
apostle of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>W. I know that, when thou doest good to others, evil
is not present with thee.</p>

<p>M. Then thou wouldst instruct Paul?</p>

<p>W. Nay: but I would instruct thee. Paul says, when
he would do good, others prevented him. When others
prevented him from doing good, evil was present. Hast
thou not seen evil in opposing good to others, when others
opposed the good thou wouldst have done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>M. Others will not oppose their own good.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou not opposed the instruction we would
give thee?</p>

<p>M. I have not assented to all thou hast taught.</p>

<p>W. Have I taught thee else but good?</p>

<p>M. Thou hast taught what thou wilt say is good.</p>

<p>W. Have I taught what thou wilt say is evil?</p>

<p>M. Thou wilt not say it is evil.</p>

<p>W. But what sayest thou?</p>

<p>M. I will say, I will worship God as I have done.</p>

<p>W. Canst thou worship God without fear?</p>

<p>M. I can worship him in my own way.</p>

<p>W. Will thy way be acceptable unto God?</p>

<p>M. I trust it will not be displeasing in his sight.</p>

<p>W. Then, thou canst worship without fear.</p>

<p>M. I can, if I do my duty.</p>

<p>W. What, then, is thy duty?</p>

<p>M. To worship God.</p>

<p>W. How, worship God?</p>

<p>M. By obeying him with all my heart.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou a heart to obey what is unreasonable?</p>

<p>M. His commands are reasonable.</p>

<p>W. What are his commands?</p>

<p>M. He commands us to love him with all our hearts.</p>

<p>W. Is that all?</p>

<p>M. He commands us to love our neighbor.</p>

<p>W. Is that all?</p>

<p>M. He wills that all should repent.</p>

<p>W. Thou hast well replied. Dost thou obey, in all
things, his commands?</p>

<p>M. I have not done all that I ought to have done.</p>

<p>W. When dost thou expect to do what thou shouldst
have done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>M. Why, thou knowest that mind is imperfect, and
God has made an atonement for sin.</p>

<p>W. Has he made an atonement for all sin?</p>

<p>M. He has made ample provision for all who believe.</p>

<p>W. All who believe in what?</p>

<p>M. All who believe in the atonement he has made?</p>

<p>W. Will that belief save thee, or others?</p>

<p>M. I trust it will.</p>

<p>W. Then belief, in an atonement, will save. Has it
saved thee, or others, from all sin and wrong?</p>

<p>M. It will save all who believe.</p>

<p>W. How canst thou decide, that what does not save,
will save?</p>

<p>M. By the promise which God has made.</p>

<p>W. Where is the promise?</p>

<p>M. In the Bible.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou other promises?</p>

<p>M. Nay.</p>

<p>W. Wilt thou bring me that promise of God?</p>

<p>M. The whole Bible is proof of it.</p>

<p>W. But I ask where, in the Bible, is that promise?</p>

<p>M. The Bible says, repent and believe, and thou shalt
be saved.</p>

<p>W. When wilt thou repent?</p>

<p>M. I have repented of my sins, and found forgiveness.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou any sins which thou hast not repented of?</p>

<p>M. Peradventure, I have many.</p>

<p>W. Will the atonement save thee from them?</p>

<p>M. I trust it will.</p>

<p>W. But has it saved thee from them?</p>

<p>M. I will hope for my salvation.</p>

<p>W. On what promise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>M. On the promise of God.</p>

<p>W. Wilt thou read that promise?</p>

<p>M. That which thou askest, is not mine to give.</p>

<p>W. That which thou hast, is thine to give. That
which thou hast not, is not thine to give.</p>

<p>M. Thou wilt not say, I can not read such promise.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt read, when thou canst find it.</p>

<p>M. The whole world may read it.</p>

<p>W. Not till they find it.</p>

<p>M. Then thou deniest such promise?</p>

<p>W. I deny no promise, but thou hast not found it.</p>

<p>M. I will find it.</p>

<p>W. I will wait thy finding.</p>

<p>M. Here is a passage, which favors such promise,
“Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?
It is God that justifieth.”</p>

<p>W. I will not lay any thing to the charge of God’s
elect. But will God justify thee, or others, who have not
repented?</p>

<p>M. I hope for justification through the blood of the
cross.</p>

<p>W. Dost thou hope for justification, while thy sins
remain? Thou shouldst not hope for what is wrong.</p>

<p>M. Is it wrong to hope for justification through faith?</p>

<p>W. It is not wrong to hope for justification, when thou
hast repented of all thy sins; but thou wilt not find justification
in thy wrongs.</p>

<p>M. Then faith will not justify the mind.</p>

<p>W. Faith will not justify without works of good.</p>

<p>M. Will works justify without faith?</p>

<p>W. Works will not justify, unless they are good; and
good works will justify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>M. How can they justify without faith?</p>

<p>W. They justify themselves, because they do not contradict
each other. They are consistent with good, and
in harmony with the law of God. They will justify the
mind who acts well, because mind will not work a wrong,
when good is done. When mind obeys God, by obeying
the law which God has established in the wisdom of nature,
he will not be condemned. God will not condemn
a mind in opposition to his law. But nature will afford
no justification without repentance. In vain is faith without
works, because it is dead, and does no one any good.</p>

<p>M. Then, thou wouldst justify the heathen, if they do
good?</p>

<p>W. Yea; and not evil.</p>

<p>M. But will not the heathen be justified through faith?</p>

<p>W. When their faith works by love, and purifies their
hearts.</p>

<p>M. Suppose it does not work by love.</p>

<p>W. Then, thou mayest suppose it is dead, and will not
justify.</p>

<p>M. But when is faith not dead?</p>

<p>W. When it works, when the work is good, and when
others feel the benefits thereof.</p>

<p>M. But does not Jesus say, “Thy faith hath made
thee whole?”</p>

<p>W. Yea; and thou seest why.</p>

<p>M. Because faith saves.</p>

<p>W. When it works, not otherwise. Thy faith hath
not made thee whole, as thou sayest.</p>

<p>M. My faith will, I trust, make me whole.</p>

<p>W. When will thy faith make thee whole?</p>

<p>M. Thou mayest not dispute the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>W. When will thy faith make thee whole?</p>

<p>M. When the atonement is perfected in me.</p>

<p>W. When will the atonement be perfected in thee?</p>

<p>M. The day will come when all shall stand before God.
Then all will know who are justified, and who are not.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not say, that thou wilt be justified,
when thou shalt stand before God, unless thy works are
in harmony with the law of God? Neither wilt thou
prove that thou dost not even now stand before God. But
art thou justified now by faith?</p>

<p>M. I have said, I hope to be justified, when I stand
before God, in the judgment.</p>

<p>W. Why dost thou hope, then, for justification?</p>

<p>M. Because I believe.</p>

<p>W. Does thy belief justify thee now?</p>

<p>M. Thou wilt not receive the true faith.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt not answer, neither wilt thou show how
thou canst be justified hereafter, by thy faith, when thy
faith doth not now justify thee.</p>

<p>M. How, then, am I to be saved?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt be saved by repentance. When thou
shalt turn from the error of thy ways; when thou shalt
no longer excuse thyself for thy neglect to do thy whole
duty; when thou shalt see no mind neglected, because of
thy indifference, but shalt do unto thy neighbor good, as
his mind may need, without letting thy left hand know
what thy right hand doeth; when thou shalt no more
publish thy own worthiness, nor detract thy neighbor’s;
when thou shalt have compassion on the poor, and the
stranger within thy gates; when thou shalt no more oppress
the weak, nor extort from the needy; when thou
shalt love all mind, and curse not; when thou shalt know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the truth, and have courage to acknowledge it; when thou
shalt teach and practice the wisdom of God; then wilt thou
find justification through faith, because thy faith will work
by love for the good of all mind; and thou wilt stand before
God justified, and saved from the ignorance and
wrong, from which thou hast long expected deliverance,
but found it not.</p>

<p>Then all the circle said, “Amen;” and we departed to
the temple, not made with hands.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> arriving at the temple, each mind took its proper
position, and Contentment was made wisdom to the workmen.
“Thomas,” said William, “art thou satisfied with
thy journey?”</p>

<p>T. I am satisfied that I am not as others whom we
have seen; but I would that they were altogether as we
are.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt now prepare thyself for what thou wilt
soon see disclosed to thee. Thou art not as thou wilt be
when the more excellent glory shall be unfolded before
thee. Take thy work, and bring it before the inspector,
that thou mayest receive thy reward; for thou hast borne
the banner, and wilt receive thy recompense.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not mark the work as mine; for what
I have done, thou hast aided me to do with thy fellow
servants, our brethren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>W. Thou wilt come with us, and present thy work;
for what we have done is thy work, and thou hast done
is our work. Our work and thine are one, and thou wilt
with us receive each a penny.</p>

<p>T. Then thou mayest give my wages to the poor.</p>

<p>W. Thy wages are thine, and what is thine, thou wilt
receive. It will not be as thou hast supposed. Wilt thou
bring thy work?</p>

<p>T. Yea; and here it is.</p>

<p>“The work is well,” said the Inspector.</p>

<p>W. Take thy work to the second Inspector.</p>

<p>The work was laid before the Inspector, who said, “It
is well, but thou shouldst not hew the stone without a line.
I will square thy work. It is well with the square.”</p>

<p>“Take thy work to the third Inspector,” said William.</p>

<p>“Here is my work,” said I, advancing toward him.</p>

<p>Ins. Thy work will square itself. Take thy penny.</p>

<p>“Thy reward is well without the penny,” said I.</p>

<p>I. Thou wilt receive thy wages, because thou hast not
worked thy work by reason of the reward.</p>

<p>T. What wouldst thou have me to do with my wages?</p>

<p>I. Thou wilt serve thy brethren who have need.</p>

<p>T. Perchance, they will not receive the gift.</p>

<p>I. Thou wilt not need what thou hast, but what thou
hast not, thou wilt not refuse, till thou shalt have tried it
by thy own experience, and found it wanting. Thou wilt
now receive a lesson, which will teach thee how thou mayest
not use thy wages, and remember that thy wages is
what thou wilt now receive, because thou hast been faithful
in some things, thou shalt be a ruler in many things.</p>

<p>Taking my arm, the mind said, “come.” We were soon
in a more magnificent temple than any which I had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
before beheld. There was a great company of minds, who
were seated on each side of a spacious hall, adorned with
brilliant gems on walls of light; while over our heads were
ministering spirits of a generation who shared the glory of
the Prince of peace. Directly before me stood superior
minds, and behind me a long line of warriors with broken
spears and rusty guns without locks. Their arms of warfare
trailed in the march, and their countenances betokened
that they had won a victory without injury to themselves
or others.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt hear a lesson from the throne of mercy,”
said William. “Advance near thy Teacher, that he may
place his hand on thy head.”</p>

<p>Advancing to the required position, the mind arose and
said, “Thomas, thou hast made a good profession in that
thou hast been obedient unto the commands of thy master.
Thou wilt permit me to place this crown upon thy
head. It is not the crown of tyrants, nor of usurpation;
but it is a crown of glory, which the Lord of this tabernacle
hath desired me to put on thy head. Thou hast
worn a crown of thorns, but now thou hast sought and
found the pearl of great price, even the wisdom which
seeks the good of those who need, without hope of gain or
fear of loss; because thou hast loved thy brethren, who
have received thy aid, thou mayest wear this crown of
glory. See that thou keep thyself in the way of wisdom,
that thy crown may grow brighter and brighter with the
using, and not tarnish with rust. Thou wilt not work
where thy wisdom will be scorned, but thou wilt go with
thy companions to a sorrowing and dependent circle, who
will receive thy message with gladness. Thou wilt do
the meek and the humble what thou canst not the proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and the disdainful. Thou wilt now take with thee this
helmet and this spear, and this sword of two edges, and
these arrows and bow, and these stones and sling; and
thou wilt also take this trumpet, that thou mayest be
armed with the armor which thy work requires of thee.
And, when thou needest aid, thou wilt sound the trumpet
with the sound that I teach thee, so shalt thou not work
alone, but thy companions will aid thee, as thou shalt find
labor required. Soon thou wilt go on a mission, which
will require all thy wisdom to overcome the midnight of
darkness that surrounds the wretchedness of minds, led
captive by the deceitfulness of ignorance and folly. Be
thou prepared to show thyself a workman, that needeth
not to be ashamed of thy calling, for in due time thou wilt
reap what thou hast sown; because what thou sowest will
bring forth an hundred fold to the glory of God and the
good of mind. Take with thee thy elder brother, whose
counsel thou hast so wisely received, and also thy companion
to whom thou art allied by mutual affinities, and we
will wait thy summons. Turn now to the right, and let
the chief of this tabernacle give thee further advice.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt go on thy mission, my friend, but before
thou goest, it is proper that thou shouldst receive some
advice, which thou mayest need. The crown which thou
wearest will not suffer tarnish, because it is thine. Thou
hast not usurped it, nor hast thou deprived others of any
right which unto them belongeth. All they ever had,
thou hast taken nothing, but what thou hast is a crown,
which we give thee for thy glory. This crown is not the
crown of a king, but of a ruler. Thou wilt wear it ever
in thy warfare, that thy mind may be loved as thou lovest
with unabated affection. Thy authority will not be increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
by it; but thou wilt shew thyself a ruler, whose
counsel will be respected, because wisdom will guide thee.
When thou rulest, thou wilt not control as do kings and
emperors, but thou wilt exercise thy reason, and thy reason
will be respected. This crown is placed on thy head to
make known the majesty of truth, which is shielded by it
from all harm. No mind can fault a crown, when honored
by wisdom in him who wears it. The crown is well;
but the abuse of power is not guarantied by this gift.
Thou wilt not abuse thy authority by contributing to the
welfare of the rich, from the industry of the poor. Such
is not the authority conferred on thee by this crown. But
thou wilt contribute from the income of the rich, to aid
the poor. Those who need will receive thy care, and thou
wilt exercise thy wisdom to convince the rich that thy
crown should be worn by them. And when they come to
lay their gifts before thee, thou wilt say, ‘remember the
needy,’ for these words are written on this crown. Thou
wilt also say, ‘take this crown from my head, when I
dishonor it, by refusing to obey its requirements.’ Therefore,
let these words be true and faithful in thy way, and
let thy conduct show that our confidence has not been
misplaced. My aid will be given thee in the work of reform.
Thou wilt now receive thy lesson from the commander
of this temple, who will tell thee what thou wilt
do with the warlike implements thou has received from
the chief. Proceed to his chair.”</p>

<p>Turning to the right, so as to face about, I came before
the commander, who addressed me as follows:</p>

<p>“Hast thou been a warrior?”</p>

<p>“I have not assumed to fight with such weapons.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt now assume to fight the good fight of wisdom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
The helmet is thy protection against harm. Thou
wilt wear it evermore. Thou wilt not use it in mortal combat,
for thou hast not enlisted for such service. But thou
hast engaged to do thy duty, and where thy duty calls
thee to scenes of wrong, this helmet will aid thee to overcome
the hostility of contending parties. It will shield
thee from the wrongs of the ignorant, and the assaults of
the wicked. Thou seest the word written thereon. It is
Peace. The peace thou wilt bear in thy bosom, will overcome
the resistance of wrong, and war will cease. The
helmet will protect; for war never rages where peace reigns.
Thou wilt bear the banner and the helmet, and no foe will
attack thee, because there will be no resistance offered by
thee, save the power which thy example will inspire in the
minds who wrangle with each other. Thou wilt first publish
thy motives in the camp of the enemy, and when they
read thy words, they will say thou art beside thyself,
much peace hath made thee insane. But thou wilt say,
‘much peace have they who love the law of harmony and
happiness.’ Thou wilt say, ‘this helmet is peace,’ and
when they shall unite with thee and thy companions, war
will end with them. This helmet will not tarnish. The
wisdom of God hath made it, and what God hath made,
thou wilt wear with honor to thyself, and satisfaction to
thy friends.</p>

<p>“This spear is warlike. Thou wilt not war with thy
brethren with this weapon. It is given thee for a nobler
purpose than the destruction of enemies. It will serve
thee in the battle thou wilt fight, because it is not carnal.
It is a spear that will touch the hearts of enemies. It will
make no wound, but it will heal the wounds which wrongs
have made. When the spear enters the hearts of warriors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
it will touch a well of sympathy. When the well is found,
thou canst strike the spear deep, and it will not harm.
Thou wilt so use this weapon as to find the heart, and
when the heart is found, the victory is won. The heart
must be touched with the spear of love; and, therefore,
thou seest the importance of this instrument. Let thy
warfare be such as will touch the heart, and when thou
shalt find thy weapon unavailing, thou wilt take this
sword with two edges, and lop off the dead branches which
overshadow thy efforts, and which yield no fruit. When
thou hast cut down the dead branches with thy sword,
thou wilt take thy spear, and engraft the fruitful olive
branch therein. When thou hast done thy work with
thy spear and sword, thou wilt see a great reform in the
tree, and new branches will put forth, bearing much fruit
to the husbandman.</p>

<p>“These arrows and bow will not make thee unfriendly,
except thou pervert them to works of injustice to thy brethren.
Thou knowest the history of David and Jonathan.
When Saul sought the life of David, he was forewarned
by an arrow, which Jonathan shot. It was well with
David, and well with Jonathan, because they made a covenant
with each other to avert wrong. The arrows were
united, and being united were strong against resistance.
Take these arrows as a sign of the covenant thou hast made
with us, that no wrong shall come unto thee without warning;
and take also this bow, which is the power of the
covenant; and, with it, do thy work as thou hast covenanted
to do, in friendship, love, and truth, and hope of
mercy will descend without ending upon thee in thy labor.</p>

<p>“Take also this sling and these pebbles; and, when thou
goest on thy mission, thou wilt not make war with those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
that oppose thee. They are given thee for another purpose.
Thy soul will need its rest. Thy sling will bring
thee rest. Thou wilt take the pebbles, one by one, and
when thy opposer shall make war with thee, thou wilt
teach him this lesson: That no wisdom is found in pebbles,
and thou wilt say to him, ‘silver and gold have I
none, but such as I have, give I unto thee. Take this sling
and these pebbles, and when thou art without wrong, cast
them at me, for I too, am poor and needy, and what thou
doest, do as thy wisdom shall direct.’ Then shalt thou
find thy sling and pebbles retained by thee, and thy opposer
will be thy follower in the great reform of mind.
And when thou shalt have need of our aid, blow the
trumpet as thou hast been instructed, and thy companions
will join thee in the good fight of reforming mind, without
blood or treasure.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt now proceed on thy mission, and, when thou
shalt aid with thy wisdom the needy, thy work will be
thy reward. Hitherto, thou hast been instructed, but now
thou wilt be an instructor of others. Thou wilt work thy
work of reform, as thou canst. Take what thou needest
for thy work, and go to the castle, where thou didst unfurl
the banner, and when thou shalt sound the trumpet,
thy circle will obey thy summons.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an hour of devotion. The castle was ruffled by
the storm of darkness. Not a voice betokened harmony,
and each worshiper offered his words to God, as a dictator
would his commands to his subjects. One mind wanted
his brethren to be more faithful, and another desired the
conversion of a third to some opinion, which would disgrace
the mind who should practice it. At length, we
went to a deacon of the most fashionable circle in the castle.
He was offering his words to God. “Thou wouldst have
been just,” said he, “if thou hadst cut us down as cumberers
of the ground, and made our bed in hell; but we thank
thee, oh God, that thou hast not been strict to mark our
iniquities against us, lest our portion should have been as
hypocrites and unbelievers.”</p>

<p>“Often hast thou not heard that accusation?” said my
companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>T. I recollect that was often said by many thoughtless
religionists, when I was in the body.</p>

<p>M. And dost thou not know that what thou hast seen
in the body, thou mayest see now thou art in this sphere,
and more clearly; even so, what thou hast heard.</p>

<p>T. I see that death changes no error, which the
mind has received. These minds must have been religious,
in the first sphere. They are now religious, in
words. They tell God he is not just; for, if he had been,
he would have placed them with hypocrites and unbelievers.
I see they are mistaken. God is just, and I find them with
hypocrites and unbelievers. I see they offer words only.
They pray to have God do what they ought to have done
themselves. They want others to be converted by God,
but they do not reform themselves. Do you know the
reason?</p>

<p>M. I see that they are blind to their own condition; they
are blind to a more exalted principle of holiness. They
have done nothing to reform themselves, because they have
expended all their strength in words. They have sought
to establish their own righteousness, and thou seest that their
righteousness is words; and, when they have worked to
convert others, they have made only a convert like unto
themselves; they have made a convert with words, and
with words they will convert others.</p>

<p>T. When they were in the body, how were the needy
neglected?</p>

<p>M. As they would be here, were no other help to be
found.</p>

<p>T. Thou hast well said, Mary, that they worship
only with words. They worship only words. God is not
worshiped. They ask in words, but words never work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
without deeds, the reform of mind. They desire with
words, that God would reform minds; but they never reflect,
that reforms are works. Alas! they will not reform
themselves, and do works meet for repentance, because
they are blind in the conceit of words. Thou seest their
great mistake. Not till they shall see that God is not
pleased with their words, and words only, will they look
for a change in themselves. So long as they seek to establish
a religion of words, they will neglect a religion of
works. When they shall learn that God is just, and that
they have their portion in company with hypocrites and
unbelievers, they will not rest in words alone.</p>

<p>M. But thou seest they will not reform, because they
are blind. When their blindness shall be removed, they
will see something.</p>

<p>T. Truly: They will see themselves, not as they now
see, but as God sees them. They will see that repentance
must begin with them. They will see that words will not
save. They will see that hypocrites will not be cut off
because they have no words; neither will unbelievers fail
of a recompense on that account. Thou knowest words
entice sinners, and sinners use enticing words; but the
mind without this castle relies on works of wisdom.</p>

<p>The deacon concluded his invocation, and I said, “What
art thou praying for?”</p>

<p>He replied, “I want the wicked to be saved.”</p>

<p>T. From what dost thou desire their salvation?</p>

<p>D. From the wrath of God, and the damnation of hell.</p>

<p>T. Dost thou expect that words will serve thy design?</p>

<p>D. Thou knowest that God has commanded all men
to pray, and that the fervent prayer of the righteous
availeth much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>T. I wish to know, if words will save?</p>

<p>D. Words will find favor with God.</p>

<p>T. Will they cause God to save a wretched mind?</p>

<p>D. They will avail much.</p>

<p>T. With whom?</p>

<p>D. With God.</p>

<p>T. How much will they avail?</p>

<p>D. They will save the soul from perdition.</p>

<p>T. What will save a soul from perdition?</p>

<p>D. The prayer of the righteous.</p>

<p>T. Have thy prayers saved thee?</p>

<p>D. I trust they will save my soul, if I am faithful.</p>

<p>T. Faithful in what?</p>

<p>D. Faithful in my duty.</p>

<p>T. What is thy duty?</p>

<p>D. To obey God.</p>

<p>T. What is obedience to God?</p>

<p>D. Obedience to God is complying with his commands.</p>

<p>T. Hast thou complied with his commands?</p>

<p>D. I would try to do so.</p>

<p>T. Hast thou done as God has commanded thee?</p>

<p>D. I have come short of his glory.</p>

<p>T. Will thy prayers save thee, when thou art not as
he commands?</p>

<p>D. I will obey.</p>

<p>T. When?</p>

<p>D. When I pray, I pray for my forgiveness.</p>

<p>T. Dost thou expect God will hear without repentance?</p>

<p>D. I do repent when I pray.</p>

<p>T. What are thy works?</p>

<p>D. I see, you want me to be what you are.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not say, I want thee to be as I am, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
as God is; and when thou art as he has required thee to
be, thou wilt not refuse thy mind what good thou mayest
enjoy. Wilt thou say, that thy prayers will save thee
without repentance?</p>

<p>D. Nay.</p>

<p>T. When wilt thou repent, then?</p>

<p>D. What dost thou mean by repentance?</p>

<p>T. I mean that reform which will save thee from the
wretchedness of this confinement in walls.</p>

<p>D. Am I wretched? Nay.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not so reply, when thy deliverance is
accomplished.</p>

<p>D. Deliverance from what?</p>

<p>T. From thy wrongs and errors, thy sins and sorrows.</p>

<p>D. Verily, thou art confident. Who gave thee power
to work in God’s name?</p>

<p>T. I will work as my master has commanded.</p>

<p>D. Who is thy master?</p>

<p>T. The mind who controls me and others.</p>

<p>D. Am I not a mind who controls others?</p>

<p>T. Thou controlest thy inferiors, not thy superiors.</p>

<p>D. Thou mayest do the same.</p>

<p>T. Not as thou hast done.</p>

<p>D. Why not?</p>

<p>T. Because thou controlest by fear and hope. Thou
rulest as do tyrants and kings. Thy ways are cruel and
oppressive, unjust and wrong.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not accuse me, when thou art wrong.</p>

<p>T. When thy ways are opposed to the commands of
God, am I wrong to inform thee?</p>

<p>D. Nay; but thou wilt not be wrong, when thou art
converted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>T. Converted to what?</p>

<p>D. Converted to the religion of the Bible.</p>

<p>T. Wherein do I need conversion to the religion of the
Bible?</p>

<p>D. In refusing to join with us.</p>

<p>T. Is that the only reason?</p>

<p>D. It is one which makes thy conversion necessary.</p>

<p>T. Why necessary?</p>

<p>D. Thou knowest thou art not a believer in the Bible.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not convert me without the Bible.</p>

<p>D. What! not convert thee without the Bible? How
sayest thou that the Bible is thy guide?</p>

<p>T. I say, thou wilt not convert me without the Bible.</p>

<p>D. May I hope to convert thee with it?</p>

<p>T. Thou mayest not hope for conversion to thy views.</p>

<p>D. What views may I hope to convert thee to?</p>

<p>T. Such as are true and practical, wise and good.</p>

<p>D. When wilt thou come to me for instruction?</p>

<p>T. When thou canst instruct me.</p>

<p>D. Thou art not a believer in religion.</p>

<p>T. Thou canst tell by my works.</p>

<p>D. Thy works will not wrong any one.</p>

<p>T. Wilt thou not wrong any one?</p>

<p>D. Not intentionally.</p>

<p>T. Wilt thou justify an unintentional wrong?</p>

<p>D. Nay.</p>

<p>T. Then thou shouldst reform.</p>

<p>D. Why?</p>

<p>T. Because thou doest many unintentional wrongs.</p>

<p>D. Thy charge will not satisfy me of wrong.</p>

<p>T. When thou seest thy brother in need, hast thou
aided him? When thou seest him disconsolate, hast thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
cheered him? When thou hast found him naked of wisdom,
hast thou clothed him with garments of salvation?
When thou hast found him an hungered and thirsting
after righteousness, hast thou fed him with the bread of
heaven, and given him the water of life?</p>

<p>D. That has been my desire.</p>

<p>T. Have thy desires been operative to the good of
mind?</p>

<p>D. I would they had been more so.</p>

<p>T. Then thou shouldst put away thy craft, and leave
thy habitation of darkness. Thou wilt not do as thy soul
desireth, so long as thou remainest imprisoned within the
walls of this castle. I see thy intentions are well, but thy wisdom
is selfish. When thou shalt relinquish thy wrongs,
and no longer wrong others by the inculcation of thy
errors, then thou wilt reform the abuses of thy brethren,
without money and without price.</p>

<p>D. I would reform any wrong that I may have, but I
would first know the wrong.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt, then, understand what thy wrongs are?</p>

<p>D. Truly.</p>

<p>T. Thy wrongs are the wrongs of others. When thou
wouldst forsake thy wrongs, because thou hast seen them,
thy brethren offer thee a bribe to refuse a reform. They
say to thee, “What good will this new doctrine do? what
will those gain who embrace it? and what will they lose
that defend it?” Thou hast been warned by awful penalties
not to forsake the wrongs thou hast cherished from
thy childhood.</p>

<p>D. I acknowledge that I have my fears.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt acknowledge that thy fears do thee no
good, when they make thee miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>D. They sometimes make me unhappy.</p>

<p>T. When they make thee unhappy, they are unprofitable.
No good thing ever made thee so. That which
makes thee unhappy, is a wrong to thee; and when thou
shalt put away that wrong, thy unhappiness will cease;
but so long as thou shalt cherish the wrong, thy mind will
be disturbed by it. This is the law of God in nature.
Wouldst thou obey that law?</p>

<p>D. I would obey God.</p>

<p>T. Thou wouldst obey God by obeying his law?</p>

<p>D. I would not disobey his law.</p>

<p>T. Dost thou not see, that it is the law of God, which
works thy unhappiness? Dost thou not know, that nothing
can be true and right which makes thee unhappy?</p>

<p>D. I see, that when I do wrong, I want what I have
not got. I want something which will make me more
happy. But it is not wrong to want what I have not got.</p>

<p>T. Thy wants are well; but not thy wrongs to satisfy
thy wants. Thy wants are misdirected; they work harm
to thy mind. It will not be so, when thou understandest
the law which should govern thee. Thou wilt not reform,
nor leave this castle, till thou seest that all good is obedience,
and all evil is disobedience to the law of God. So
long as thou shalt remain subject to the wisdom of those
who instruct thee to do wrong, that good may come to
thee, thou wilt not refrain from thy wrongs. Thy errors
are thy wrongs; and, if thou wouldst be saved from their
curse, thou shouldst cast them away.</p>

<p>D. That would I do, when I have found the wrong.
But I see no error in my faith.</p>

<p>T. Thy faith is not well when wrong.</p>

<p>D. Yea; but wherein is it wrong?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>T. I heard thee say, that God was not just. If God
be not just, who will not be like him when arrested for
judgment? Thou seest that thy accusation is wrong;
and thy wrong hath disturbed thy quiet. When wilt thou
reform of thy wrong, if thy God be unjust?</p>

<p>D. But when I said he was unjust, I meant that he
was so merciful, as not to punish the wicked as their sins
deserve; not that he was an unjust God.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not put new wine into old bottles, lest
it ferment and break the bottles, and the wine be lost.
Thou hast made the rent no better. If God will not
give the wicked what they deserve, he is unjust, and is not
faithful to his promise. Besides, how can the wicked separate
themselves from the evil of a violated law? When
the law is disregarded, a wrong is done; and, when a
wrong is done, the evil is committed. The evil is the
wrong. The wrong is what disturbs thee, and what disturbs
thee is thy reward. Thy reward is the judgment
of God, executed in thy mind, because thy wisdom needs
improvement.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not say, the wrong is the reward.</p>

<p>T. The wrong is the evil, and the evil is what thou
shouldst abandon for thy good; because what is evil to
thee, thou shouldst not pursue. The law which rewards
thee, is eternal, and, while wrong is cherished, the reward
is thine. What is thine, thou wilt receive, for it is just.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not say, the wrong is the reward.</p>

<p>T. I will say, the wrong and the reward are inseparable.</p>

<p>D. Then where is the necessity for a day of judgment?</p>

<p>T. The necessity is nature’s law; but thy views are
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>D. They are what the Scriptures teach.</p>

<p>T. Thou hast not read the Scriptures without thy wisdom
to aid thee. Thy wisdom is not the wisdom of
God.</p>

<p>D. Wherein do they differ?</p>

<p>T. Thy wisdom is the wisdom of minds like thee; those
who are like thee, are no wiser than thyself. Those who
are no wiser than thyself, can not instruct thee. They
agree with thee, and thou seest only what thy wisdom has
unfolded to thee. And when thou hast read the Scriptures,
thou hast understood as thy wisdom corrected the
Bible. It is thy misfortune to read with thy education to
correct the reading, and make it conform to thy errors.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not say, there is no judgment.</p>

<p>T. I say, law is eternal, and when wrong is done, a
law is violated. When a law is disobeyed, the disobedience
is wrong, and the wrong disturbs the doer. This
disturbance of law is sure to be attended with the evil
which wrong brings. That evil is the judgment of God.
I know no other judgment.</p>

<p>D. Thou knowest the Scriptures teach another judgment.</p>

<p>T. I know not what thou affirmest.</p>

<p>D. The Bible speaks of a judgment.</p>

<p>T. So do I.</p>

<p>D. The Bible says, God will judge the world.</p>

<p>T. So do I.</p>

<p>D. When will he judge the world?</p>

<p>T. When the world do wrong, and when they do
right.</p>

<p>D. That is always.</p>

<p>T. Truly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>D. Then God judges all minds when they do wrong,
and when they do right?</p>

<p>T. Yea.</p>

<p>D. How can he judge those who do right?</p>

<p>T. As he does those who do wrong—by his eternal
law. But wrong is judged as an evil, and right as a good.
Hence, the mind that does wrong, is judged as wrong;
and the mind that does right, is judged as right.</p>

<p>D. How can there be, then, a day of judgment?</p>

<p>T. The day of judgment is when God judges by his
law, and not till his judgment is withheld, will that day
end. I know of no end to his judgment, nor to the
period in which he judges. His judgment is just, and
his justice endureth forever.</p>

<p>D. When will the wicked be judged?</p>

<p>T. When they are wicked. No mind can do wrong,
without receiving a just recompense of reward.</p>

<p>D. Of what benefit, then, is the atonement of Christ?</p>

<p>T. Thy wisdom will be increased, when thou shalt see
the atonement in thyself, and not hope for it because another
has it.</p>

<p>D. I do not understand thy meaning.</p>

<p>T. When thou shalt agree with thy Bible, in regard
to the atonement, then thou wilt find the atonement in thy
works, as thou seest it now in Christ.</p>

<p>D. This is more perplexing to me still. What dost
thou mean by atonement in me?</p>

<p>T. I mean the works which Christ done for the good
of the needy. He gave sight to the blind, hearing to the
deaf, health to the sick, and wisdom to the foolish.</p>

<p>D. Dost thou say, miracles can be done by me?</p>

<p>T. Thou canst do as thy Master hath said. If thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
wilt follow him, thou mayest lay hands on the sick, and
they shall recover; thou canst take deadly serpents in thy
hands, and they shall not harm thee; thou canst drink
poison, and it shall not injure thee; thou canst wait on the
suffering, and the Lord thy God will bless thee.</p>

<p>D. Then thou sayest, I am not a follower of Christ?</p>

<p>T. Thy works testify of thee.</p>

<p>D. Do they testify, that I am not a follower of Christ?</p>

<p>T. If thou wast his disciple, his works would follow
thee.</p>

<p>D. Then, I am not his disciple.</p>

<p>T. So thou sayest. But wouldst thou be?</p>

<p>D. I would be ever as my Master.</p>

<p>T. Listen then to thy Master’s instruction.</p>

<p>D. What instruction?</p>

<p>T. Such as I have, give I unto thee. Visit the sick,
those in prison, those in need; and let thy mind be passive
to the influence of those who would aid thee to be wise,
and the glory of God will deliver thee from thy darkness,
and make thee a light to them that dwell with thee in this
castle of vain and empty words without deeds.</p>

<p>D. Dost thou say, that I can do miracles?</p>

<p>T. Thou canst do as thy Master hath required thee,
and, when thou doest, thy works will testify that a miracle
hath been wrought by thee. Thy companions will
say, thou hast a devil.</p>

<p>D. If I could believe thy saying, I would follow thee.</p>

<p>T. Thou canst follow thy Master, and my saying will
be verified by thy works. The atonement will be in thee
to do the will of thy Master.</p>

<p>D. Then all may atone for their sins.</p>

<p>T. All may do good to those in need, and when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
obey the law of God which requires good to be done, the
atonement is in them who obey. It is an agreement with
Christ to put away sin by personal sacrifice upon the altar
of sympathizing humanity. Doing good is atonement,
because it is agreement with the law of God, and puts
wrong away.</p>

<p>D. Then, there was no need of a Savior.</p>

<p>T. Not so: had there been no wrong, there would
have been no Savior; but, where wrong is, there is a need
to be saved from the wrong. Thy Savior came where
wrongs existed, and where great injuries were practiced;
and thou seest he saved many from their errors and wrongs.
Thou shouldst obey, and do likewise; and, when thou
shalt do as thy Master hath done, thou wilt save many.
According to thy wisdom and thy diligence, so shall thy
reward be.</p>

<p>D. But, when I obey, do I not then make atonement
for sins?</p>

<p>T. When thou obeyest, thou doest well, but thou wilt
not obey without a cause. Thy obedience is caused by
thy wisdom, and thy wisdom is increased by instruction,
so that thy salvation is caused by those who instruct thee
in wisdom.</p>

<p>D. Then I have as many Saviors as I have instructors.</p>

<p>T. I would not contradict thee; but still thou shouldst
understand that all wisdom is of God. Thy God is thy
Savior, and he saves thee in harmony with his law of developing
and making wise thy mind. He saves thee only
as thou becomest wise, and he makes thee wise through
the mediums who are competent to instruct thee in his
wisdom. As many as are employed in unfolding to minds
the wisdom of God, are saviors to those whom they instruct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and make wise. Thou mayest be the savior of
many when thou receivest wisdom to instruct others. Thou
wilt not save without wisdom; for it is by wisdom that I
come to thee with a message which will open the gates of
a celestial circle, who wish thy deliverance.</p>

<p>D. Thy pretensions stagger me. If thou art what thy
words signify, thou canst do thy will, and make me what
thou desirest.</p>

<p>T. I will then invite thee to a circle without these
walls. Wilt thou go with me?</p>

<p>D. I will go, my friend.</p>

<p>T. When thou shalt arrive at the arch-way of a temple,
not made with hands, thou wilt wait till I announce
thy coming. Then, we will proceed into a court, where
thou wilt hear and see many things. Let thy mind be
calm, and thy vows be faithfully observed. Thou wilt not
return to this castle for the purpose of carrying away with
thee thy creed, or thy forms of worship. In the temple,
we worship God, not with words alone, but with works of
good. Thou wilt love thy brethren, and no hate can disturb
thy mind. Thou wilt serve God by doing good to
those that need; for thou knowest that God hath no dependence
of aid from us; but he requireth us to obey him.
Thy obedience will do thee good, as it will others on whom
thy labors shall be bestowed. Art thou ready?</p>

<p>D. I am ready.</p>

<p>T. Then come with me.</p>

<p>My companion said, “Let us sing the new song.”</p>

<p>We stood on the walls and sung the song of jubilee;
for mind which was imprisoned was released. Then we
departed for the temple.</p>

<p>On reaching the temple, my companion said, “Seest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
thou this temple of the living God? Thou wilt wait with
me, while Thomas shall announce thy willingness to enter
the courts of the redeemed.”</p>

<p>I entered the temple, and was hailed by the Master,
“What hast thou brought with thee?”</p>

<p>T. The deacon, who has listened to my wisdom, and
desirest instruction in the mysteries of thy work, wishes
admission within this court, and instruction in ways he has
not known.</p>

<p>M. Hast thou instructed him, as most necessary to his
improvement, before entering this circle?</p>

<p>T. I have said that which was necessary, and find him
prepared to receive the lessons which appertain to his
progress.</p>

<p>M. Then thou wilt bid him welcome.</p>

<p>I returned. When I returned, he said, “This is a secret
society, I suppose.”</p>

<p>T. The wisdom of this circle, who work in this temple,
is not a secret to those who have received it.</p>

<p>D. Why dost thou keep thy wisdom a secret?</p>

<p>T. Because all wisdom is a secret to the uninformed.
Thou wilt understand that this circle withholds no good
thing from those who need, but even those who need, are
not always prepared to receive our aid. The secret will not
harm thee, neither will it do good to those who refuse to
comply with its requirements. The secret is a secret only,
because minds know it not, and have resolved not to receive
the wisdom which their condition requires to make
them skillful workmen in the temple. Art thou prepared
to enter with me, and do the work which may be required
of thee for the good of mind?</p>

<p>D. I am ready to do justly, love mercy, and walk
humbly, in the path of righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>T. Thou wilt remember the poor and thy vows.</p>

<p>D. The needy thou hast with thee.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt soon become rich.</p>

<p>The same instruction was imparted to the deacon, which
I received on my first visit to the temple. When the lessons
had been repeated to him, I inquired, “Welcome,
wilt thou now revisit the castle with me, that we may aid
our brethren to see the light thou hast beheld?”</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not expect that I would refuse to aid
them. We returned.</p>

<p>The wonder in the castle—Dialogue between the chief, the deacon, and

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we reached the castle, there was great wonder and
astonishment, that the deacon should have departed from it.
I heard the chief say, “I have been suspicious of him ever
since the conversation between the centurion and the strangers
through the port holes. I saw,” said he, “that he
listened quite too attentively to the conversation; for it is
not possible for any mind to resist the arguments which
that circle brings. But alas! there is great danger of their
sentiments; there is such a sweetness in their conversation,
that it is no wonder that they draw minds away from the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou taste that sweetness?” said the deacon.</p>

<p>C. I would not jeopardize the eternal interests of my
soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>D. Then thou shouldst abandon that castle, as I have
done.</p>

<p>C. Art thou my judge?</p>

<p>D. I judge no mind, but I know thy condition.</p>

<p>C. My condition, I hope, is well.</p>

<p>D. Whereon doth thy hope rest?</p>

<p>C. On the rock of eternal truth.</p>

<p>D. What is truth?</p>

<p>C. The truth is not what thou wouldst teach in thy
apostacy.</p>

<p>I said, “Wilt thou answer the question? We wish to
know what is truth.”</p>

<p>C. Dost thou wish to relieve thy new convert?</p>

<p>T. I wish thee to tell us, if thou canst, what is truth?</p>

<p>C. I will not say, that works are the truths of God.</p>

<p>T. Wilt thou say, that they are not the truths of God?</p>

<p>C. Yea.</p>

<p>T. Then, what is nature, but the work of God?</p>

<p>C. Nature is a work of God.</p>

<p>T. Is nature a true work of God?</p>

<p>C. It is.</p>

<p>T. Then the true work of God is nature, and as thou
sayest it is a true work, it is a truth of God. That which
is true, is a truth; and that which is false, is not true.
The truth of nature is a work of God. The wisdom of
nature is the wisdom of God.</p>

<p>C. But there is a wisdom which is not of nature.</p>

<p>T. Wilt thou teach me that wisdom?</p>

<p>C. It is the wisdom of the Bible.</p>

<p>T. What wisdom is not of nature?</p>

<p>C. The Bible.</p>

<p>T. The Bible is not wisdom, but a revelation of wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>C. The Bible is full of wisdom.</p>

<p>T. The Bible is full of the wisdom of nature, which is
God’s work.</p>

<p>C. The Bible teaches us wisdom.</p>

<p>T. It reveals wisdom.</p>

<p>C. The Bible reveals what nature does not.</p>

<p>T. What wisdom does it reveal, which nature does
not?</p>

<p>C. It reveals a resurrection of mind from the rudimental
to a superior condition.</p>

<p>T. Does not nature do the same?</p>

<p>C. Not to minds in the rudimental state.</p>

<p>T. It reveals the resurrection of many things.</p>

<p>C. What?</p>

<p>T. The flower, the reptile, and the insect.</p>

<p>C. But it does not reveal the resurrection of minds.</p>

<p>T. It may do so. It has revealed it to us, and we
may reveal it to minds in the body. Is not that nature
which gave the Bible?</p>

<p>C. In one sense it is.</p>

<p>T. Is it not in every sense?</p>

<p>C. Philosophically, mind and spirit are one thing; but
mind is not the cause of nature without God.</p>

<p>T. Truly. Mind is the natural work of God, and
mind has revealed the wisdom of God, as it has been
discovered. This revelation is the Bible, which discloses
the undiscovered wisdom of God, by minds who have
learned it by their investigation of nature, which is God’s
work.</p>

<p>C. That is true.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt see, then, that nature is true to God;
and when a thing is true to him who made it, it can never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
be untrue. Even so, is that true to thee which is adapted
to thy welfare. But that which is adapted to thy welfare,
may not be adapted to the welfare of all minds.</p>

<p>C. Thou makest truth change with the condition of
mind, then.</p>

<p>T. Not so. I would say, that conditions change.
When the conditions of mind change, that which was
true in one relation, may be false in another, because a
thing, not changing with the condition of the mind, can
not be true to it in all conditions. Thou art satisfied within
these walls. To thee, they are necessary and true, being
adapted to thy condition of developed wisdom; but thou
wilt not say, that such confinement would be true to my
happiness, or that my condition would admit of happiness
to me therein. When thy wisdom shall be increased, the
things which are true to thee now, will give thee no satisfaction,
because they will not be adapted to thy condition.</p>

<p>C. Then, what is true to me now, will be false when
my wisdom shall be increased.</p>

<p>T. That which is true to thy condition will be eternally
true to that condition; but it will not be true to a different
condition. Thou wilt remember, that thou must be the
judge of all things presented for thy consideration. Laws
are eternal; but a knowledge of all the laws of God must
be forever finite. What knowledge thou hast of those
laws, is true to thee, but greater knowledge will show thee,
that what thou regardest as true to thee, will soon not be
so regarded; because thy wisdom will see its falsity. And
what thy judgment receives as true, is true to thee; and
what thy wisdom decides is not true, that thou wilt reject
as false. Hence, truth being determined by thy wisdom,
must be true to thy wisdom. It can not be true to thee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
contrary to thy wisdom; because that which thy mind receives
contrary to thy wisdom, is false to thy good, and
destructive to thy enjoyment.</p>

<p>C. Thou reasonest well; but the Bible is reasonable,
and thou shouldst not set up thy reason contrary thereto.</p>

<p>T. The Bible is one thing, and thy views another.
The wisdom of thy interpretation is not reasonable to me.</p>

<p>C. What interpretation of the Bible is reasonable?</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not say, that a mind can impart that
which it does not understand.</p>

<p>C. What then?</p>

<p>T. This will show thee, that what minds have not understood,
they have attempted to interpret, because what is
understood, does not need an interpretation. When a work
is so written as to be understood by those who read, it
will not need an interpretation, and when it is not so written,
it is defective.</p>

<p>C. Then, thou sayest the Bible is defective.</p>

<p>T. I say, that if an interpretation be necessary to understand
it, it is defective; and, when minds solicit an
interpretation thereof, they admit the defect. If there
were no defects, why ask for an interpretation?</p>

<p>C. I want what will make it plain and clear.</p>

<p>T. What will supply some defect, I conclude.</p>

<p>C. That will be a saying what infidels allege.</p>

<p>T. Is it not doing what infidels say, when thou askest
an interpretation? They tell thee, that wrongs are in the
Bible, and thou wilt not say, that the Bible is right without
an interpretation. So, the interpreters of the Bible
and infidels are agreed, that the Bible is not right without
an interpretation?</p>

<p>C. That is apparently thy conclusion, but it is a new
idea to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>T. The idea will be more than apparent, when thou
shalt divest thy mind of thy doubts. Thou hast more
skepticism than is consistent with thy good.</p>

<p>C. This is the first time I was ever accused of skepticism.</p>

<p>T. Thy friends have been like thee, and thou wouldst
not listen to those unlike thee. When thou wouldst know
thy wrongs and errors, thou wilt not expect thy willing
companions, whom thou lovest because they flatter thee,
and thou payest them, for their flattery, will tell thee what
will occasion thy displeasure.</p>

<p>C. I want no wrong, nor error.</p>

<p>T. Thou wilt not forsake thy wrongs or errors, until
thou art instructed to see them; and thou art not prepared
to forsake when wisdom reveals them to thee.</p>

<p>C. I will forsake them when I see them.</p>

<p>T. When may I expect thou wilt see them?</p>

<p>C. I wish to see now.</p>

<p>T. When I show thee, wilt thou forsake?</p>

<p>C. I will.</p>

<p>T. Then listen to the counsel and experience of the
deacon. He will aid thee to see what is wrong, in thy
mind.</p>

<p>C. I am prepared to hear and judge for myself.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt now call thy friends together, that they
also may hear and judge.</p>

<p>C. I wish no one present at this interview, but the
present company.</p>

<p>D. What is good for thee, will be good to those like
thee.</p>

<p>C. But I do not wish my friends to know that I am
considering a new doctrine. They will rebuke me for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
my weakness. Thou canst say what thou desirest, and, if
I am satisfied, I will call them together.</p>

<p>D. Thy wisdom is wrong.</p>

<p>C. Wherein?</p>

<p>D. In that thou art not willing thy friends should hear
what thou permitest thyself. What is good for thee is
good for them.</p>

<p>C. What is good for them to hear, I would have them
hear, but I wish to know first that what thou desirest me
to hear is good; and when I know it, I will not object to
the hearing of all.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt not refuse to hear thyself without knowing
what thou mayest hear. Why dost thou do what thou
wishest others not to do?</p>

<p>C. It will be unwise for me to permit a doctrine to be
inculcated among minds, who are likely to be carried away
with new things. They are aided only in the right way
by me; I would not have them taught wrong.</p>

<p>D. Thou wilt suffer thyself to be taught right.</p>

<p>C. Yea; and also my friends.</p>

<p>D. Then thou mayest call them together.</p>

<p>C. How am I to know that thy instruction is right?</p>

<p>D. When thou hearest it, thou canst judge, and so
can thy friends.</p>

<p>C. But I do not choose to have them hear it, until I
can judge.</p>

<p>D. And yet thou art willing to hear for thyself. Why
shouldst thou do what thou refusest to thy friends?</p>

<p>C. Because what I hear will not injure them, unless
they hear.</p>

<p>D. Then thou hast more confidence in thyself than in
thy brethren. Are they not like thee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>C. They are like me, in faith; but I would not trust
their judgment, when thy words of honey are offered to
them.</p>

<p>D. And yet thou canst trust thy own.</p>

<p>C. Whose should I trust?</p>

<p>D. Whom should thy friends trust? Thou requirest
them to trust in thee. Why shouldst thou require them
to trust in thee when thou refusest to trust in thy friends?
We have not wronged thee, nor will thy friends be wronged
by us.</p>

<p>C. Thou mayest wait. I will counsel with the senior
of this castle.</p>

<p>When we saw what he wanted, we summoned the circle
in the temple by a certain sound of the trumpet. They
came. On sounding the trumpet, the hosts of the castle
came also. It was a clear, still evening, and when they
saw our implements of war, they formed in a circle near
the walls, and demanded the object of our mission.</p>

<p>The Commander of the temple replied, “Be not alarmed.
What thou hast is thine, and we have no need of what is
thy own. We are here not to take away what thou hast,
but to give thee more abundantly than thou hast reason
to expect. Thou wilt soon see the object of our mission;
and, when thou seest, thou wilt not consider us thy enemies,
but friends. We see thy arms are defective; and,
if thou wouldst fight, the weapons we bring are at thy
disposal. Advance and receive, and, when thou receivest,
use them as thy wisdom shall direct thee.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sen.</span> Then thou surrenderest thy command to our
power?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Com.</span> We surrender what thou desirest—our weapons
of hostility. Come now and receive, that thou
mayest know we are not thy enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>S. Thou wilt keep thy own. We do not fight with
friends.</p>

<p>C. Why shouldst thou fight with enemies?</p>

<p>S. Because they are not friends.</p>

<p>C. Will thy fighting make them friends?</p>

<p>S. It will make them know that they are not our
masters.</p>

<p>C. How will it teach them this?</p>

<p>S. Because they will become our servants. Our victory
over them will teach them this lesson.</p>

<p>C. It will teach them another lesson also.</p>

<p>S. What lesson?</p>

<p>C. It will teach them, that thy victory may be reversed,
and that thou mayest become their servants. What <i>thou</i>
doest, others may do. Thou wilt see, that thy power may
become the power of those whom thou mayest oppress.
When wilt thou understand, that thy warfare is wrong to
thee, and to those whom thou mayest injure?</p>

<p>S. When our enemies become our friends.</p>

<p>C. Very true. And wouldst thou desire all minds to
become thy friends?</p>

<p>S. We would desire peace, but not on dishonorable
terms.</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt not say, peace is dishonorable, on any
terms.</p>

<p>S. I will say, when minds are asked to surrender their
rights as a condition to peace, it is dishonorable.</p>

<p>C. Dishonorable to whom?</p>

<p>S. It is dishonorable to him who surrenders.</p>

<p>C. Is it dishonorable to give?</p>

<p>S. When the gift is demanded, as a condition of peace.</p>

<p>C. When thou askest for rain and sunshine, as a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of thy prosperity and peace, is it dishonorable for
thy Friend, who controlest the seasons, to give thee what
thou askest?</p>

<p>S. Nay; because he is not impoverished by his gifts.</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt not say, it is dishonorable for thy friends
to offer thee weapons of war, when they have no others?</p>

<p>S. It is not, when we are not thy enemies.</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt say, “when we are thy friends.”</p>

<p>S. Yea.</p>

<p>C. How wouldst thou make thy enemies thy friends?</p>

<p>S. By doing, as I would that they should do to me.</p>

<p>C. Wouldst thou be refused, when thou askest what
thou desirest?</p>

<p>S. Nay.</p>

<p>C. When thou desirest peace, wouldst thou refuse it,
because thy enemy wanted what was thine, as a condition?</p>

<p>S. I would not submit to unreasonable demands.</p>

<p>C. What wouldst thou do?</p>

<p>S. I would refuse the condition.</p>

<p>C. Wouldst thou refuse the condition, if the condition
was better for thee and thy friends, than to fight?</p>

<p>S. I would not submit to any unjust demands.</p>

<p>C. Wouldst thou not submit to an unjust demand,
rather than to demand what is unjust?</p>

<p>S. I would not demand what is unjust.</p>

<p>C. Dost thou not demand peace, and is not that just?</p>

<p>S. Yea.</p>

<p>C. Then, when thou refusest what thy enemy asks,
as a condition of peace, dost thou not refuse peace, and
demand war. The condition is what makes peace, and
when thou refusest that, thou desirest what is worse. Is
it honorable to choose the greatest evil?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>S. The greatest evil is not war.</p>

<p>C. What is greater?</p>

<p>S. The evil of injustice.</p>

<p>C. It is even so. But is not war unjust?</p>

<p>S. Not when waged in a righteous cause.</p>

<p>C. What cause is righteous, which is unjust?</p>

<p>S. That which maintains rights. Rights are just, and
measures, which will secure and perpetuate those rights,
are just.</p>

<p>C. Is war a right?</p>

<p>S. War is not right, when rights are not sought by it.</p>

<p>C. How can rights be sought and obtained by wrongs?</p>

<p>S. War is not wrong, when rights are secured by it.</p>

<p>C. When rights are secured by wrongs, when war
secures peace, when nature is concordant with discord, thy
rights will disappear. No mind will then have any rights,
because rights will be valueless. When war becomes right,
and right becomes war, the rights of nature will be disregarded.
Confusion will be right, and peace become wrong.
Such is the character of thy rights, when judged by the harmonious
law of nature. Thou sayest, war is right to secure
rights. What right wilt thou secure by war?</p>

<p>S. Those rights which are the inherent property of
every mind.</p>

<p>C. And what is the inherent property of every mind?</p>

<p>S. The right to say and to do, as my own conscience
approves.</p>

<p>C. Will thy conscience do evil, that good may come?</p>

<p>S. Nay.</p>

<p>C. Is war an evil?</p>

<p>S. It is.</p>

<p>C. Wouldst thou go to war, which thou sayest is an
evil, that good may come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>S. It will not be evil, when good comes from it.</p>

<p>C. Wilt thou show us what good can come from evil?
Doth war do those engaged in it good?</p>

<p>S. If it secure to them a right, the right is good.</p>

<p>C. The right will not go to war.</p>

<p>S. The right will go to war when it is right.</p>

<p>C. Wilt thou show us, when it is right to do evil, that
good may come from it. Wilt thou show us how good
can come from evil, or evil from good?</p>

<p>S. The good, which comes from the evil of war, is
the maintenance of rights.</p>

<p>C. What rights?</p>

<p>S. The rights which are in controversy.</p>

<p>C. What rights in controversy have ever been secured
by war?</p>

<p>S. The rights of freedom.</p>

<p>C. When?</p>

<p>S. The rudimental condition has secured these rights.</p>

<p>C. When?</p>

<p>S. When the American colonies were opposed by the
mother country.</p>

<p>C. What rights did those colonies secure by war?</p>

<p>S. The rights of freedom.</p>

<p>C. Those rights were not secured by war.</p>

<p>S. Well, they were the results of war.</p>

<p>C. Nay; but of peace. When peace was ratified, the
colonies were no longer engaged in war. Thou seest not
that war gave to any mind a right, because it gave different
things.</p>

<p>S. But was not that war justifiable?</p>

<p>C. How so?</p>

<p>S. To overcome the oppression of the mother country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>C. Canst thou make one wrong justify another?</p>

<p>S. No; but I see no wrong in that which results in
good.</p>

<p>C. Thou hast not shown that wrong ever did, or ever
will, result in good.</p>

<p>S. But I will show, that the American colonies would
never have been free without it.</p>

<p>C. Thou mayest say, that they are not free with it.</p>

<p>S. How dost thou mean? Are they not free from the
mother country?</p>

<p>C. How can a people be free, who are dependent?
Are not the States as dependent now as ever on the mother
country? Whence cometh her luxuries, which thou
seest crossing the Atlantic? Whence comest her language,
her customs, her religion, her glory in war, and her manufactured
articles which her people import? Are these
signs of freedom, or of dependence?</p>

<p>S. But they are free to enact their own laws, and
choose their own rulers?</p>

<p>C. They are free to choose as the majority may elect.
I would say a majority of such as are not proscribed by
law from choosing their own rulers. But thou seest more
than one half of those who are ruled by law, who have no
choice in the election of their rulers, and very many, who
have a secured right to elect, do not exercise it.</p>

<p>S. That is their own fault.</p>

<p>C. Whose fault?</p>

<p>S. The fault of those who are governed.</p>

<p>C. Why is it their fault?</p>

<p>S. Because they should assert their rights.</p>

<p>C. What rights?</p>

<p>S. The rights which others exercise.</p>

<p>C. What rights do others exercise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>S. The rights to elect minds to make laws, and govern
them.</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt see who will object to their assertion.</p>

<p>S. I see who will not object.</p>

<p>C. Who?</p>

<p>S. The free and independent.</p>

<p>C. Who are they?</p>

<p>S. Those who dare speak the truth, and act without
fear.</p>

<p>C. And who are they?</p>

<p>S. They are not many, I see.</p>

<p>C. Then how are the few to control the many?</p>

<p>S. I would not make war against them.</p>

<p>C. What wouldst thou do?</p>

<p>S. I would instruct them in the great principles of
natural justice.</p>

<p>C. Thou hast well said. When thou seest thy enemy
come against thee to wrong thee of thy rights, instruct
him in the great principles of natural justice, and when
thou hast instructed him, he will not trespass against
thee. We saw thee afraid of thy rights; but thou knowest
that, when, we offered thee our weapons, thou didst refuse,
because thou hadst no enemy to fight. So, when
thy enemies make war on thee, go, and meet them, and
say unto them, we are friends, take our weapons; and
they will say unto thee, we have no use for them, for we
are brethren.</p>

<p>S. The wisdom of my companions agrees with me, that
thy doctrine would be well, if all would practice it. But
thou seest that such is the ignorance of some minds, that
compulsory measures must be resorted to, in order to
restrain their acts of injustice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>C. Compulsory measures are dangerous weapons.
When a mind is restrained, it is not free; and when it is
not free, it hates the oppressor. That which it hates, it
seeks an opportunity to overcome, and circumstances may
so change as to gratify its wish. The time will come
when war will be no more; but it never will come so
long as compulsory measures are employed to restrain
minds. I have seen war. I have seen the causes of war.
I never saw a cause of war equal in wrong to the war.
No cause, which has hitherto produced war, has ever been
so wretched for minds to bear, as the evils of war. What
are a few insults, or wrongs of dishonor, when compared
to the wretchedness of whole nations, engaged in mortal
combat? Would not the wrongs of injury be abated by
the forgiveness of thy Savior? Would he wound to redress
his wounds? Why did he not call the legions of
heaven to fight with the legions of earth? When thou
shalt have full confidence in the righteousness of his conduct,
and when thou shalt follow his example, thy honor
will not tarnish, though thou forgivest thy enemy even
seventy times seven. And when thou shalt do the works
of thy Master, the cause of thy Master will be honored in
thee.</p>

<p>S. Thy wisdom will not allow sincere minds to call
themselves Christians, because they would defend their
own rights.</p>

<p>C. Thou hast no right to wrong thy neighbor, even
though he may be thy enemy. Thou hast no right to do
wrong. War is a wrong. It is an evil, as thou hast said.
Thy enemy will not be made thy friend by thy wrong;
neither can thy mind be satisfied with the wretchedness of
thy wrong. It is not war which bears the name in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
rudimental sphere, which we have undertaken to overcome
in our visit to this castle. We have not come here
to do away with that which does not exist among thy
companions, but to instruct them in principles of everlasting
peace to thy mind. Thou hast not yet forgotten the
wrongs of thy education, and those wrongs have made
thee suspicious of thy friends. Thou wouldst now repel
words and facts which will be of more value to thee than
many rubies. If thou wouldst heed our advice, we would
say to thee, and thy companions with thee, come with us,
and we will do thee good.</p>

<p>S. Thou mayest stay with us.</p>

<p>C. We have been where thou art, but now we have a
more beautiful mansion, where the pure current of life rolls
down from the throne of mercy, and all who will, may
come and drink of the water of life freely. Thou wilt
not return to this castle to tarry, when thou shalt participate
in the blessedness we share. We are now ready
to receive thy reply.</p>

<p>S. I should be willing to try the experiment, if my
companions would go with me.</p>

<p>C. Thy companions will rejoice at the opportunity. I
see they are willing and hoping that thy answer will be
yea.</p>

<p>S. Thou seest, then, that I will go.</p>

<p>C. Thou hast wisely answered. Thy companions will
go where they wish, and thou wilt consult their wish.
When thou findest one who will do wrong to obtain a
right, pass on; and when thou findest one who will only
do right to obtain a right, and who will sacrifice his own
for another’s good, thou wilt write the name in the Lamb’s
book of life, which thou wilt take with thee; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
scribe whom we send with thee. When thou returnest,
report thy success.</p>

<p>He went with the scribe. On their return, they brought
in the book the names of four and twenty elders, and an
hundred and forty and four thousand, who came with
them, saying, “Blessed is he who hath part in the first
resurrection; for lo! these many years have we sought
and not found; but now the light shineth, and the darkness
comprehendeth it not.”</p>

<p>S. I have brought with me a hundred and forty and four
thousand, who have resolved to worship no more in this
castle, but go with thy companions where thou wouldst
lead; albeit, where reigns the principles thou hast taught
unto us. Thou wilt see these four and twenty elders, who
came to thy hearing, have joined the great congregation,
and are ready to live in peace, as thou hast taught.</p>

<p>C. Thou wilt form a circle that I may address them when
we reach the arch-way of the temple, whither thou goest,
I have a few words to say to them, which will need be
required before they enter therein.</p>

<p>S. We will obey thy commands.</p>

<p>The new song was now sung, for the year of Jubilee
had come to these emancipated minds. They sang in the
spirit, and with the understanding, the words painted in
gold colors on my banner. The great congregation then
moved straightway for the temple. On nearing the arch-way,
a circle was formed, and the Commander addressed
them as follows:</p>

<p>“Friends: Thou wilt suffer no more from the ills to
which thou hast been exposed in thy pilgrimage. Thou
hast not known thy misfortune, because thou hast verily
been unable to compare thy condition with that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
thou art now prepared to realize. Thou hast hitherto considered
thy own wisdom above the wisdom of thy superiors;
but when thou seest what remains for thee, thou
wilt know thy condition was wretched, when compared
with it. Before thou enterest this temple, each mind will
cast his crown into the treasury of reform, and when thou
seest the standard enter the arch-way, thou wilt follow in
the order of thy conductors, and receive such lessons as
thy need may require from thy seniors. Be wise not in
thy own conceit, for there are none too wise to unlearn his
wrongs, nor too good to neglect improvement, save Him
whom we serve. Let no wrong follow this company into
these courts, for shame will hide no guilt from the inspection
of this circle.” The whole company were conducted
in order, and received the lessons which appertained to
their progress, and which have been recited in another
place.</p>

<small>FOURTH VISIT TO THE CASTLE.</small></h2>
</div>

the king—Conversation with him—He refuses wisdom—A dialogue
with a mind on fear—Calls a great multitude to hear the elder—Address

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the conclusion of the lesson, the Master said,
“Thomas, thou wilt go with the four and twenty elders,
and see what remainest in the castle.”</p>

<p>The command was obeyed. When we reached the castle,
we saw a dense cloud resting over the place, and there
was a large number which no mind could count, wondering
at the departure of the hundred and forty and four
thousand. It was a day of fasting and prayer. The
elders said, “They mourn without success. The Lord hath
done great things for us, whereof we are thankful. We
will listen to their lamentations.”</p>

<p>Presently, a mind descried us, and straightway he went
to the citadel. I heard his report to the king, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
he met at the gate. “The four and twenty elders have
returned, and have taken their position on the wall, where
thou hast ordered thy servant to stand.”</p>

<p>K. What is their report?</p>

<p>M. They have just arrived—I heard no report.</p>

<p>K. Then take with thee thy guard, and bring me word
what they may say unto thee.</p>

<p>M. They bear no arms.</p>

<p>K. Then go thou with thy company, and hear their
report.</p>

<p>The centurion came, and said, “the king desireth a report
from thee, and I am the messenger.”</p>

<p>The elder of the elders replied, “Tell the king we have
found favor with God; for, verily, he dwelleth not in temples
made with hands, and we are satisfied with all we
have seen and heard.”</p>

<p>M. Dost thou wish to return to the fold again?</p>

<p>E. We have come to tarry only while we may do thee
and thy fellow servants good, as our Master hath commanded
us. Wilt thou say to the king, that the half was not
told us before we left the castle. We have tidings of great
good for all who obey the truth, and are faithful to the law
of harmony and peace. We invite the king and his household
to hear our report, which will end thy fasting, and
soon change thy sadness into joy.</p>

<p>M. Then I will report thy wish to the king.</p>

<p>I went with him, but the elders remained. The messenger
entered by the north gate, and when he approached
the palace, the king’s servant required us to wait. Soon
the king made his appearance, and said, “Bringest thou
a report?”</p>

<p>M. I have a message for thee from the elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>K. Thou mayest say to them, come where I am, that
I may see them face to face.</p>

<p>M. Lo! they are waiting thy pleasure.</p>

<p>K. Invite them all to my council chamber.</p>

<p>We all went where he requested.</p>

<p>“I am now ready to hear the report of the elders,” said
the king.</p>

<p>“May it please thee,” said the senior, “we have found
favor with God, and grace and peace are multiplied unto
us. We have washed in a stream, and thou seest our garments
are white as snow. The circle will receive thee,
when thou art willing to cast thy crowns into the treasury
of good, and learn war no more. Thou wilt not regret
the sacrifice, for what thou consecratest to the good of
mind, will do thee more honor than all thy works of power.
We saw a mystery unfolded to us, which will not do thee
good, until thou shalt become acquainted with it also.
The mystery of iniquity thou hast understood, from thy
reception into the throne of power; but the mystery of
godliness thou mayest yet learn. There are minds who
can teach thee the mystery of mutual confidence. It will
not be taught thee here; for now thou art surrounded
with minds distrustful of each other. Thou distrustest
them, and they distrust thee. But we have found a circle
where no mind distrusts, because they know each other’s
thoughts. The whole circle need no compulsion to do
right, because right is their meat and drink. They delight
in right, and wisdom is always with them. They
worship God without fear, and love one another without
dissimulation. There is a rainbow over their heads, and a
cloud of fire by night to warm their hearts with love forever.
There no iron rule becomes necessary to enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
obedience; for obedience is loved, and what is loved is not
avoided. The Master is not a tyrant, but a father; and,
when the father commands, his children delight to obey
his commands. What is the wish of the father, is the
wish of his children. Hence, no disorder or wrong can
enter the circle we have found.”</p>

<p>K. Then, thou art satisfied with what thou hast seen
and heard?</p>

<p>E. We are satisfied with what we have seen and
heard. We will not return with thy permission to tarry here.</p>

<p>K. When wilt thou return to thy new friends?</p>

<p>E. When we can do no good here.</p>

<p>K. Thou wilt not expect to convert me?</p>

<p>E. We expect only thy pleasure. It is not our will to
control thee, but to aid thee in the path of true wisdom
and happiness.</p>

<p>K. Hast thou not been flattered with new things?</p>

<p>E. We have seen, and do testify, that new things have
been discovered to us.</p>

<p>K. When new things have been found, is it not prudent
to test them by experience before we trust too implicitly
in them?</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt not test them, we apprehend, even as
we have done.</p>

<p>K. When thou hast tested them, I will hear thee
again.</p>

<p>E. Would it not be better for thee to test them by thy
own experience?</p>

<p>K. It would not be better, if I disliked the experience.</p>

<p>E. True; but thou wilt have no experience without
a trial of them.</p>

<p>K. I will wait thy tests.</p>

<p>E. We will wait thy pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>When he had concluded, we departed to a mind who
was not unwilling to hear, because he had no authority to
rule over others. He was wholly depressed in his mind
about relieving himself from his fears.</p>

<p>“Thy fears disturb thy quiet,” said the elder.</p>

<p>M. My fears not only disturb my quiet, but the quiet
of others.</p>

<p>E. Why dost thou fear?</p>

<p>M. How can I help my fears, when every thing makes
me fear?</p>

<p>E. Thou mayest be aided, so that thy fears will not
control thee.</p>

<p>M. Thy confidence I do not realize.</p>

<p>E. My confidence will be thine, when thy fears are
removed.</p>

<p>M. That will not soon be realized.</p>

<p>E. I know thy condition, and thou knowest that as
thou art, even so I once was. Dost thou remember me?</p>

<p>M. I have seen thee, but thou dost not wear the same
garments? Why didst thou change?</p>

<p>E. I was with thee, when thou didst first enter within
these walls. I was thy teacher, when thou wast where thou
wouldst not return. I saw thee, when thou wast in a
condition that elicited my sympathy. Dost thou wish
farther relief?</p>

<p>M. I would not refuse what thy kindness has to bestow.</p>

<p>E. Thy fears will not be removed without instruction.
What thou fearest is what should be overcome. I will
aid thee to see that thy fears are not true to thee, nor true
to thy progress.</p>

<p>M. Thou wilt not say, my sincerity is not true?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>E. Thy sincerity is no proof of thy faith.</p>

<p>M. What is well I believe.</p>

<p>E. Thou believest what is not well.</p>

<p>M. What do I believe, which is not well?</p>

<p>E. That which thou fearest is not well.</p>

<p>M. Thou wouldst not banish all fear.</p>

<p>E. He who fearest is not made wise in love; because
what is feared is not hoped for, but dreaded as an evil.
I would remove all fear, for thou canst not fear and be
free. When thou fearest, thou art in bonds, and when
thou art in bonds, thy heart is unreconciled to thy condition.
It is not satisfactory to thyself. Thy unreconciliation
is dissatisfaction with thy condition. Thou
wouldst hope for better things, but thy mind hath been
instructed in many errors which remain to disturb thee.</p>

<p>M. Thou hast said, in thy pilgrimage with us, that
what I believe was true.</p>

<p>E. I said, as I believed; but thou wilt understand
that belief is not always correct. Thou canst believe because
of my saying; but thou canst not know without investigation
and tangible facts. The circle, which bids me
labor for thy good, walk not by faith but by wisdom. They
are not controlled by opinions or faiths, but by actual experiments.
It is not actual experiments and demonstrations
of facts which weary thy mind, and paralyze thy
industry, but it is thy opinions and doubts. They are
the messengers of discontent and trouble. If thou wouldst
distrust thy distrust, and doubt thy doubts, thy mind
would feel the inspiration of hope. When thy mind
hopest for good, thy confidence is superior to thy doubts.
Then the despondency of thy condition vanishes.</p>

<p>M. But what have I to hope for?</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt ask, what is there which I may not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
hope for? There is no good, which thou mayest not attain.
The wisdom of circles, whose glory thou hast not
seen, may be thine by receiving it. But thy doubts cause
thee to reject thy own good. When the prize is offered
thee, thou refusest, because of thy unbelief. Thy doubts
distrust and reject the best good. They rob thee by thy
own consent. It is, indeed, no wonder to me now, why
thou shouldst not advance, and become more happy. I
would advise thee, but thy wisdom apprehends mischief
from me. Now, I am not of thy circle, thou fearest some
evil intention is with me. The worst evil thou canst suffer,
is the evil of resisting wisdom.</p>

<p>M. I would not resist what is wise and good, but I
would know that it is wise and good before I receive it.</p>

<p>E. How canst thou know what thy wisdom rejects?
When thou askest aid, how canst thou be benefited, so
long as the aid is rejected? Must not the aid be received
to help thee? Wouldst thou require tangible evidence,
or demonstrations of its usefulness before thou wouldst
accept what thy necessities demand? Thou askest for the
proof of a thing, when thou rejectest the only means which
can give thee the required satisfaction. As well might the
ignorant say, “I will receive instruction when I am satisfied
by experience that it will be for my advantage, and
not before,” as for thee to demand knowledge of a subject
before thou receivest the lessons, which will make thee
know the truth of the subject.</p>

<p>M. Then, I must receive what thou sayest as truth,
and test it by my experience.</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt test it in no other way than by thy experience.
All thou knowest to be good or bad, thou
knowest by thy experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>M. May I not know from others’ experience?</p>

<p>E. Thou mayest believe, but thou canst not know.
To know is to understand by the test of thy experience.
The test of experience will not deceive thee. By it thou
mayest try the philosophy which we teach. Thy mind
will not doubt what it knows; but it will doubt what
minds say; because thou hast already found many errors
in the sayings of thy friends, but never one in the counsels
of thy experience. Experience is true. However bitter
it may be from the errors of thy life, yet it is true. Falsehoods
even are true, as are facts; but there is this distinction,
which experience has established. Falsehoods
are wrongs, facts are not. Nevertheless, thou must see
that wrongs are true to falsehoods, and falsehood to wrongs.
The cause is true to its effect. If the cause be inharmonious
with good, the wretchedness must ensue. If the
cause be harmonious with mind, the effect can not be
wrong. Therefore, falsehood, being a cause, and that
cause not being in harmony with the progress and happiness
of mind, must beget its true effect when received.
That effect is wrong, and wrong because an evil is inflicted.
All evil is true to the effect it produces. When
a mind is in harmony with error, the error is true to that
mind. The error is true to its effect. It is sure to produce
its own likeness—to stamp its own image, when
received by the mind. No effect, disagreeing with the
cause, can ever exist in nature. Consequently, all things
are causes of other things, and the cause and effect are true
to each other. This is what we may call truth.</p>

<p>M. Then truth is the relation of cause and effect?</p>

<p>E. It is the relation which will disclose a truth to thee.
The things, being true to each other, will not be false to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
each other; so with mind. The things which are in harmony
with mind, are true to that mind, and the things
which are otherwise, are false. Thou knowest that, when
thou hast entertained that which was incongenial with thy
mind, it was productive only of evil. It was false to thy
peace. It was untrue to thy happiness, because the relation
was not true to thy wants. Error is error, only because
thy mind is disappointed. Truth is truth when no
disappointment occurs. Thou hast sought for peace and
happiness in things which bear no relation to thy seeking.
Thou hast not learned the philosophy of cause and effect.
When thou receivest the sayings of mind, thou hast been
sometimes deceived; and thou believest when they tell
thee what is for thy good. They, too, will not satisfy thy
mind without adapting their instruction to thy understanding.
Error has been taught thee, or things have been
offered thee which disturb the sympathy of thy mind.
They are false to thy wants. Thou seekest happiness.
They destroy it. That is false to thee and thy good.
Thou shouldst not trust in thorns to produce grapes, nor
in thistles to produce figs; but thou shouldst know that
nothing is, or ever can be true to thy good, which is, or
shall be, incongenial with the sympathy that makes thee
a child of God.</p>

<p>M. I see that thy philosophy makes no relation eternal;
because, when a thing changes, it disturbs the relation
which it has sustained to another thing.</p>

<p>E. The relation is eternal to things which are eternal.
But thy errors are not eternal things. I see they will soon
be destroyed in thee. When thou hast an affinity, or
holdest a relation to things which disturb thee, the connection,
thus formed, will be true to itself so long as it remaineth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
but when the error is destroyed by the philosophy
we teach, the relation is broken, and the effect of that
relation must cease. The error will disturb no longer than
it remaineth.</p>

<p>M. Is it not even so with the truth?</p>

<p>E. It is.</p>

<p>M. Why may not minds, then, lose the truth, and
sink into utter hopelessness and despair?</p>

<p>E. Minds may not lose the truth, when they never
have found it. Thou hast not yet found the truth. Thou
hast learned some facts. Facts are the wisdom of nature
as revealed to mind in parts. The truth is the infinite
whole, and is incapable of being divided into parts. Minds
sometimes call facts truths; but we teach that truth,
which is infinite, so far, and no father, as it has been
made known to us. Thou hast been taught the truth in
part, and what remainest for thee to learn, is what thou
hast no knowledge of. It is ignorance in thee, as it is in
us. This truth is the infinite harmony and wisdom of
God in the universe. All revelation of that wisdom, is
true to thy happiness; because thy mind is not discordant
with nature, only as thy ignorance, or education, hath perverted
it. Thus, the revelation of wisdom, agreeing with
thy happiness, is true to thee, and what is true to thee, as
cause and effect, will never be false, because it is governed
by an immutable law.</p>

<p>M. Then, thou wouldst teach that truth is eternal and
error not.</p>

<p>E. Truth is true to the good of mind eternally, because
it is in harmony with the relation of cause and effect.
Error is in harmony only with ignorance. Ignorance is
the absence of knowledge. It is the mere thing of childhood—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
infancy of mind in its eternal progress. But
when the infant becomes the philosopher, it puts away
childish things. The swaddling clothes of the babe will not
truly cover the grown man. They are true to the infant,
like the Mosaic covenant of forms to the Jewish people;
but they cover not the wants of enlarged sympathy for the
great brotherhood of mind. The infant people required
protection, and their wants were supplied. They asked
only what they received. The minds of this circle have
sought for no more than they have found. They have
sought to establish their own wisdom, in opposition to the
wisdom of a higher circle; and they have found, by experience,
the avails of their search.</p>

<p>M. Then minds can find what they seek for?</p>

<p>E. They can find the degree of wisdom which they
seek for. They can generally find whatever opinion they
prefer, because they will prefer only an opinion agreeing
with their measure of wisdom. All which disagree with
their degree of reform in wisdom is wrong. Nothing to
them is right, but the righteousness in them. They seek
for nothing more.</p>

<p>M. How, then, can they progress in wisdom.</p>

<p>E. As others influence them by instruction, as we have
sought to do unto thee.</p>

<p>M. Then thou wilt go on; I like thy philosophy.</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt see a philosophy in thy progress which
will satisfy thee, that thy errors are of no service to thee.</p>

<p>M. I am now satisfied of that, but what are my errors?</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt not receive all we wish thee to hear alone.
When thou wilt call thy friends together, who sympathize
with thee, and who have no opposition to wisdom, nor
fear of instruction, we will visit thee, and say unto all
what thou mayest apply unto thyself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>M. I will call my friends now. They hear my voice,
and will respond to my wish.</p>

<p>The multitude assembled, and the elder proceeded to
address them. “Thou hast a work to do, my friends.
The wisdom of a superior circle hath delegated to me the
duty of undoing the errors I have inculcated among the
minds of those with whom I have labored. Nothing is
more sincerely regretted, than my wrongs. It has been
my honest endeavor to do away wrong; but I find many
errors, which I have taught, and now it becomes my
pleasing duty to correct them. Among those errors, none
stand more prominent than the doctrine of imputed righteousness,
and the fears and selfishness which it has encouraged.
The principle, which imputes to another what
he never had, or will possess, is fatal to the idea of impartial
justice, and wrong in its effect upon individual responsibility.
I have found that wisdom, which discloses the
fact, that thy wrongs can not be justly imputed to another.
Neither is it just for another to assume thy wrongs without
thy practice. Indeed, thy wrongs are thy own, and no
one can make them his own without adopting them.
When they are adopted by another, that mind is as criminal
as he who first practiced them. So, will it be seen,
that no mind can claim happiness because another is virtuous.
The virtues of the wise must become our own, or
they will not promote our enjoyment. Thou knowest I
have taught thee to hope for good, because thy Savior was
righteous. As well might mind hope for good, because
God is good. There never was a time when God was
not good, but what availeth his goodness, until it becomes
thy own; and to become thy own, it must become thy
practice. Because one mind is good, or just, or right, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
is not true that all are so. And yet the doctrine I taught
thee, encouraged the expectation that, because thy Master
was good, he would impute his righteousness unto thee.
As well might the claim of thy righteousness be maintained,
because another was exalted to a circle of purity. Thou
hast no lessons in nature to sustain the doctrine of imputed
righteousness. All law, which recognizes equity and justice,
repudiates the slander upon the name of Jesus. He
transfers no good to thee, which thy condition will not receive
as thy own inheritance. Thou shouldst not depend
on being saved from thy wrongs, otherwise than by forsaking
them. No good can come unto thee in wrong;
and so long as thy wrongs remain, the good of thy Master
availeth thee nothing. To be saved, thou shouldst not
depend on the good of another, but on the good thou
mayest attain by seeking wisdom, and forsaking folly.
What, therefore, I have taught thee, inconsistent with this
sentiment, I would ask thee to abandon; for no good can
arise to thee from any source, without thy wisdom shall
control thee to make it thy own. And, when it is thy
own, it is not another’s. Read thy lesson of wrong no
more, and forsake the teaching which would flatter thee
with hopes of bliss, because another is more holy than
thyself. Thy Savior is he who saves. No mind is thy
Savior, unless he saves. To save is to make thee wise, and
when thou hast become wise, thou wilt put away wrongs
and errors. No mind is wise in the wisdom of my circle,
who refuses instruction in wisdom, or who neglects to
practice its requirements.</p>

<p>“I have seen thy ways, and I have watched thy mourning
with solicitude. Thou hast waited in hope for the redemption,
because another was good. Thou hast waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
for another to do what thou shouldst have done thyself.
It is this which has wronged thee. Hadst thou felt the
necessity for thy own exertions, and depended less on the
doctrine of imputed righteousness, as thou hast been
taught, I would not now need to correct the wrong I
have done. But, when thou hopest for good because another
is wise, thou art prone to security in indolence. Thou
seest that it is mischievous to encourage indolence, and
yet, when thou waitest for another to do thy work, thy
indolence is apparent. Be wise, then, and be active to be
wise.”</p>

<p>The circle said, “Who then can be saved? If we have
no righteousness of our own, and are not permitted to hope
for it in another, who among us will be saved?”</p>

<p>E. Those with thee who seek and find wisdom, and
who will not neglect the good of mind.</p>

<p>C. Then there is no need of a Savior, if we can save
ourselves.</p>

<p>E. There is no need of hoping for the righteousness
of another to be placed to thy credit; because no such injustice
will be manifest to thee. There is need of a teacher
to instruct thee in the truth of divine wisdom; and he who
instructs saves, when his instruction is received, and as it
is received. The ignorance of mind is removed by instruction,
and as it is removed, the mind instructed is saved
from its ignorance. When a mind errs, it errs not because
it naturally prefers the error, but because its ignorance
prevented the reception of wisdom. The evils, which
mind practices, are not practiced because the mind loves
the evil, in preference to good, but because, through ignorance,
it misjudged. The ignorant mind is liable to misjudge,
but the wise are instructed. Mind must love, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
prefer for itself that which is good, or that which it supposes
is best adapted to promote its own enjoyment. But
very many find their judgments in error. They do wrong
to do themselves good. True wisdom, however, reveals
the ignorance of their judgment. Good can never come
out of evil, nor evil out of good. Temporary advantage
may be taken of another’s opinion, whereby wrong may
ensue to him; and when the mind has received what it
has sought and obtained at the expense of another, it is
not satisfied, because the wrong never can satisfy what
God has made right and good. And the greater the wrong,
the greater the dissatisfaction; because right and wrong
can never agree, but must from their disagreement war
with each other. The mind, therefore, acting wrong, encourages
contention in itself, and where there is a conflict,
the law of harmony is disturbed, and with it the peace
of him whose enjoyment is dependent upon it. He who
saves is, therefore, a deliverer from these evils of ignorance.</p>

<p>C. Thou makest every teacher then a Savior.</p>

<p>E. I would teach thee, that every one who saves is a
savior. He who teaches wisdom and inculcates principles
of righteousness in the minds of others, saves them from
their ignorance and folly. Is it not so?</p>

<p>C. It so appears; but why should any mind hope for
salvation by the aid of Jesus?</p>

<p>E. The aid which Jesus brings thee, is the aid we
bring. Jesus comes not to thee, except through the circles
interlinking him to thee.</p>

<p>C. Does he exercise direct control over thy circle?</p>

<p>E. He exercises control over all circles of less wisdom
than himself; but we have been taught by others, and they
by others, and so on to the circle in which Jesus resides.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
The wisdom taught us is the wisdom he would teach,
were he our direct instructor; because it would be unwise
to undertake to develop mind, only as mind is developed
to receive instruction. The circle of wisdom, which instructs
us, could not comprehend the degree of Jesus, until
wisdom improved them by successive degrees, so that they
would be capable of receiving it. Soon will thy wisdom
unite with my circle, for I see thou art ready to receive the
truth without fear.</p>

<p>C. I have not many fears, but I have some further
inquiries, which my mind is not fully settled upon.</p>

<p>E. Proceed.</p>

<p>C. Thou hast taught us, that imputed righteousness
was unjust. How can that be unjust, which is freely offered
on condition of our acceptance, or bestowed without
our wish?</p>

<p>E. The injustice consists in the wrong. All is wrong
which is not good. It is not good to deceive thee with
wrong. The wrong is not right, and what is not right is
unjust. The wrong of deceiving thee, leads thee wrong,
and encourages thee to hope for another’s wisdom without
having the principles and works, which will be found important
to thy progress. The imputed righteousness of
Jesus will never benefit thee, until that righteousness becomes
thy own by practice. No good can come to thee,
unless the good be received and adopted. When it is
adopted, it is thine, and not before.</p>

<p>C. Thou wouldst not teach, that all evils are unjust.</p>

<p>E. Thou wouldst not reject what is well, when thou
understandest it. The well is not evil. The good is not
evil. The just is not evil. Evils are not evils absolutely.
The worst evil is ignorance. Ignorance will not live forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
in any mind—I would say, the ignorance of right
and wrong as I understand right and wrong. Therefore,
it is not an absolute evil. It is even so with all other evils;
they are temporary, not eternal.</p>

<p>C. The evil of wretchedness is worse than ignorance.</p>

<p>E. Wretchedness is the effect of ignorance. The effect
can not exceed the cause.</p>

<p>C. Yea; but it may be more lasting.</p>

<p>E. How can the effect of ignorance be more lasting
than the cause?</p>

<p>C. When minds do wrong, their wrongs remain, as
thou hast said, till they are corrected. Thou sayest that
thy mission here is to correct thy wrongs, and yet thou
claimest wisdom unknown to thee, when thy wrongs were
done.</p>

<p>E. My wrongs were the wrongs of thee, and those with
thee. When I taught thee wrong, thy wrongs justified
my teaching. Thy sympathies were as mine; but what
was my wrong, was not thine, nor thine mine. When I
came here, I came to undo my wrongs, which thou hast
adopted, and by adoption made them thine. I was wrong
as thou art; but what I would do, thou wilt not undo. I
would undo what thou canst not do. That thou mayest
understand me, I taught thee what thou didst receive and
adopt. I taught thee wrong. My wrong was in teaching.
Thou didst receive and adopt, and thy wrong was in receiving
and adopting, when thou shouldst have weighed
my saying in the balance of impartial justice and truth.
My mission is to undo my teaching, when I was with thee.
Thy duty is to undo what thou hast adopted without
weight. I told thee wrong. I now correct that wrong.
I was in error. I would now make thee to know it. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
when thou seest my folly as I see it, thy wisdom will be
increased.</p>

<p>C. Then wisdom consists in seeing our own faults.</p>

<p>E. It consists not only in seeing them, but forsaking
them. The wisdom is in forsaking follies.</p>

<p>C. Have we follies that wisdom does not approve?</p>

<p>E. Thy works must show.</p>

<p>C. What works?</p>

<p>E. Thy reform will show thee thy follies.</p>

<p>C. What follies?</p>

<p>E. The folly of depending on others to do what thou
shouldst do thyself.</p>

<p>C. What should we do ourselves?</p>

<p>E. Put away all wrong.</p>

<p>C. What wrongs should we put away?</p>

<p>E. The wrong of ignorance.</p>

<p>C. Of what are we ignorant?</p>

<p>E. Of that which thou knowest not.</p>

<p>C. What is that?</p>

<p>E. The wisdom of God.</p>

<p>C. How may we know the wisdom of God?</p>

<p>E. By instruction in righteousness.</p>

<p>C. Who will instruct us?</p>

<p>E. A circle whom we have seen. Wouldst thou be
introduced to that circle?</p>

<p>C. Thy circle will not receive such minds as we are.</p>

<p>E. My circle will prepare thy mind, and receive thee
when prepared.</p>

<p>C. Why doth thy circle not worship as we do?</p>

<p>E. Because it is not in accordance with our wisdom.
Thou wilt worship with new light, when thou seest the
wisdom which will be unfolded to thee. Now, thou seest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
with fear and trembling; but when the pure wisdom shines
upon thee from the throne of goodness, the doubts and
fears of thy mind will be dissipated with the rising glory
of eternal day. The vain imaginings of a misguided
mind, will be corrected, and the beautiful harmonies of
nature will control thy mind, and give thee peace, that
transcends thy longing soul. The voice of kindness will
rekindle thy devotions, and the sweet influence of welcome
associates, will touch the soft emotions of gratitude and
praise. Thou hast not seen wisdom so pure, goodness so
great, hope so unclouded, life so sweet, and society so
agreeable, as that to which I propose to introduce thee and
thy friends with thee. Thou wilt learn thy lessons of
love with pleasure, thy lessons of peace with content, and
no lash of fear will urge thee, when thou understandest
the joy of the blessed.</p>

<p>C. But why may I not receive the same instruction in
this castle?</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt receive thy instruction only where it is
to be found. Thou knowest such only can instruct thee
as are competent. They can not instruct thee without
removing the veil from thy face, so that thou canst see, as
well as hear, wisdom in mercy.</p>

<p>C. I would not object to leaving the castle, if my associates
would accompany me.</p>

<p>E. Thy associates are even waiting for thee to say, “I
will go.”</p>

<p>C. How dost thou know?</p>

<p>E. I know with a sight you have not obtained.</p>

<p>C. Canst thou tell my intention?</p>

<p>E. I can tell thee, that thy mind is to go.</p>

<p>C. How may I know this, and see as thou dost?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>E. By doing as I require thee. When thou shalt see
the light of the temple, thy vision will be so increased as to
discern the thoughts of mind, and when thou seest the
thoughts of mind, thou wilt no longer walk by faith, but
by sight. In this consists the wisdom of the circle to
which I now belong. They have no doubts or fears, because
doubts are the results of blindness. What thou
seest, thou canst not doubt or fear, because the truth is not
to be feared, but dispels doubts and sorrows.</p>

<p>C. Is there no fact, which ought to be feared?</p>

<p>E. The most fearful thing, which spirits need to avoid,
is their neglect of wisdom. Their opposition to improvement
is the most dangerous thing which they need fear.
It is what they should overcome. Thy fears will vanish
with the light of wisdom. They will not mar thy joy,
nor disturb thy quiet, when the wisdom of our circle
teaches thee the folly of fear. Not every one of thy companions
will go with us. I see a mind in yonder palace,
who is waiting for my experience to aid him. He will not
be aided in that manner. He wishes me to test the realities
of my circle for him, but thou canst now see, that my
test will not be a test for him. When indolence asketh
another to do what belongeth to him who is controlled
by it should do, the improvement will be procrastinated
until indolence is satisfied. There will be no reform in
the hands of indolence, and where there is no reform, there
is but little wisdom. I have seen much indolence in
this castle. I have seen much indifference to progress,
and I am satisfied that no wisdom can improve the condition
of minds here, unless that wisdom be received, to
give vitality to the works of righteousness. I wait thy
response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>C. I will try thy circle.</p>

<p>E. Thou wilt not receive what is given thee without
trying it, because the trying is what will introduce thee
into it.</p>

<p>C. Then, I can try it here.</p>

<p>E. Not till thou hast received it.</p>

<p>C. But, may I not receive it here, as elsewhere?</p>

<p>E. Thou mayest receive what thou canst here, and
practice it; but what thou lackest is sight. Now, thou
only believest, because of my saying; but when thou
seest, thou wilt know, not because of my saying, but because
what thou seest will make thee know the wisdom
which I now declare unto thee. Thou wouldst prefer facts
for faiths, realities for doubts, and stability for uncertainty.</p>

<p>C. I will go with thee.</p>

<p>E. Who else?</p>

<p>The whole company were of one mind. They all said,
“I will go.” I recorded their names in the book of life, and
found a thousand times ten thousand, who sung a new
song on the walls of scorn, and were received into the
temple not made with hands, as were the hundred and
forty and four thousand. They were made free from the
bondage of fear and doubt; and, when they were free, they
said, “Glory, glory, to the Lord God Almighty, who art
from everlasting to everlasting, Supreme over the works
which he hath made; and who suffereth no unclean thing
to frustrate the immutable counsel of his wisdom and
pleasure.” And the voice of the temple was one voice;
for joy was increased, when reform was effectual in reclaiming
so great a multitude.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> master then requested me to take with me no mind,
but go to another circle, who were sympathizers with those in
the castle. I went where there was a company, who sought
for wisdom in works of wrong. They were aided with
no light but such as they had found in the rudimental
condition. I saw them disputing about something which
they did not understand. Though I could see them, yet
they could not see me. I heard one mind say to another,
who came to instruct him in the wisdom of his circle, that
it was better to control by force than by reason.</p>

<p>The circle whom he was instructing, deputed a champion
to debate with him; and he replied, “that fear was the
only weapon to control and govern minds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“It is not the only weapon; but it is one of the most
powerful agents which need be used. I have seen some
minds so constituted,” said he, “that they could be governed
without fear, but it is not often their condition.”</p>

<p>“The condition of no mind,” replied the other, “can be
so well governed, as to let them know that what they say
and do will be punished with severity, or rewarded with
generosity.”</p>

<p>The dispute was not wise. The wrangling was wrong.
I came near them, and they said, “Who art thou?”</p>

<p>T. I am your friend.</p>

<p>C. So say all who wish to deceive.</p>

<p>T. Did I ever deceive you?</p>

<p>C. Why, then, will you not give your name?</p>

<p>T. My name will not aid you to know me.</p>

<p>C. Why?</p>

<p>T. Because, my name you never knew.</p>

<p>C. Have we never known or heard of you?</p>

<p>T. You may have heard that which I would not acknowledge,
because it might be unjust.</p>

<p>C. Then what is your mission? Are you a teacher?</p>

<p>T. I teach what I know.</p>

<p>C. Do you not teach, sometimes, what you do not
know.</p>

<p>T. I have done so; but now I do so no more.</p>

<p>C. Then your teaching must be very limited.</p>

<p>T. It is limited; and whose is not?</p>

<p>C. They who teach what they do not know?</p>

<p>C. How can a mind teach what he does not know.</p>

<p>C. As he would that which he does know.</p>

<p>T. How is that?</p>

<p>C. He can tell his views; he can teach his opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>T. True; but how can he teach what he does not
know?</p>

<p>C. I have said, as he does that which he knows.</p>

<p>T. Then he makes them know what he does not.</p>

<p>C. No; but he makes them believe as he does.</p>

<p>T. Then, when he makes them believe they are taught.</p>

<p>C. Yes, they are taught his belief.</p>

<p>T. They are not wiser, or better, for his teaching, I
conclude.</p>

<p>C. They are both wiser and better.</p>

<p>T. How so?</p>

<p>C. Because they are.</p>

<p>T. Is that your only reason?</p>

<p>C. No; they are wiser in regard to opinions and views.</p>

<p>T. In what does their wisdom consist?</p>

<p>C. It consists in being able to overthrow false opinions
and views.</p>

<p>T. Is that all?</p>

<p>C. What more can there be?</p>

<p>T. Much more, when they are wise.</p>

<p>C. What?</p>

<p>T. They can be good and just; they can speak the
truth, and lie not. They can avoid deception and wrong.
They can know something, and be serviceable to other
minds by teaching them what they know.</p>

<p>C. But minds know but little, and can soon teach that.</p>

<p>T. Do you know the reason why they know but little?</p>

<p>C. Because but little can be known.</p>

<p>T. No; because but little knowledge has been sought.
When mind contents itself with opinions and views, it
will make but little effort to gather facts.</p>

<p>C. Then, we will hear your facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>T. You will hear what may not now be said, when you
are prepared for it.</p>

<p>C. Are we are not prepared for facts?</p>

<p>T. I will not relate what you will not receive.</p>

<p>C. Why?</p>

<p>T. Because it will do you no good.</p>

<p>C. How do you know we will not receive it?</p>

<p>T. Because I see your opinions will prevent it.</p>

<p>C. Then what is your mission?</p>

<p>T. To remove your opinions when wrong.</p>

<p>C. Have we wrong opinions?</p>

<p>T. Some are right, and others wrong.</p>

<p>C. Which are wrong?</p>

<p>T. Those which cause you to wrangle.</p>

<p>C. But may we not compare our opinions?</p>

<p>T. What good will the comparison do?</p>

<p>C. It will show which are correct.</p>

<p>T. How will it show that?</p>

<p>C. The strongest will gain the victory.</p>

<p>T. The victory over whom?</p>

<p>C. Over the weak.</p>

<p>T. Well, does a victory over the weak establish what
you want?</p>

<p>C. It establishes the fact, that one opinion is stronger
than another.</p>

<p>T. How so?</p>

<p>C. Because it overpowers the weakest opinion.</p>

<p>T. Then, when one mind overcomes another, you say
he is correct.</p>

<p>C. I know of no better rule.</p>

<p>T. When the rule is secure because it is just, the wisdom
of the rule will be established, but the rule is wrong, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
therefore, the result must be wrong. Because one mind
triumphs over another, it does not prove the right on the
side of the victor.</p>

<p>C. How, then, can opinions be tested?</p>

<p>T. By experience.</p>

<p>C. Experience is on both sides.</p>

<p>T. True; but when the experience is such as to be well,
it is not ill. The mind in the wrong will have an unhappy
experience, but the mind in the right will be happy.
Therefore, my rule is to wrangle not, but let experience
test the claims of all opinions. In this way, all errors
would soon disappear without disputes.</p>

<p>C. It would be a long time to overcome errors in that
way.</p>

<p>T. Will you show how they can be overcome sooner?</p>

<p>C. I think that two minds, holding different opinions,
should discuss the difference between them.</p>

<p>T. Will a discussion of differences make them less, or
remove a single error?</p>

<p>C. I will say, I see no other way to remove them.</p>

<p>T. The wisest among you see no other way; but have
you ever known an error corrected by disputation?</p>

<p>C. I have seen some minds confounded.</p>

<p>T. The answer is true; but have you seen any one
correct his errors by controversy?</p>

<p>C. I may say, some minds have been changed by controversy.</p>

<p>T. Have they been changed so as to abandon their
errors?</p>

<p>C. The change has been well, because they have received
the truth.</p>

<p>T. What truth have they received?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>C. They have received the truth of the Bible.</p>

<p>T. What truth of the Bible have they received?</p>

<p>C. They have received the truth of wisdom, which
teaches them that a mind in a state of nature can not receive
the things of God, because it is prone to evil continually.</p>

<p>T. Is that a truth revealed in the Bible?</p>

<p>C. It is a truth which no reader of the Bible can deny.
It is a truth which God has revealed to mind.</p>

<p>T. Will you read the truth to me from that Book?</p>

<p>C. I will show you a passage. It reads, “The fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on
edge.”</p>

<p>T. Does that passage say, that mind in a state of nature
can not receive the things of God, or that it is prone to
evil continually?</p>

<p>C. It says, that the children were affected by the conduct
of the father.</p>

<p>T. What else?</p>

<p>C. Why, if they were so affected, they must partake
of the guilt of the father.</p>

<p>T. How so?</p>

<p>C. Because, it makes the children responsible for the
conduct of the parent.</p>

<p>T. How does it make the children responsible?</p>

<p>C. By virtue of the law to which they are subject.</p>

<p>T. What virtue is there in any law, which makes one
mind responsible for the deeds of another?</p>

<p>C. I see you are an infidel.</p>

<p>T. How can you see what is not a fact?</p>

<p>C. It is a fact that you cavil with God’s law.</p>

<p>T. Wherein have I caviled?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>C. By denying what is written in the Bible.</p>

<p>T. What have I denied in the Bible?</p>

<p>C. The doctrine of innate depravity.</p>

<p>T. I have not seen that doctrine in the Bible, neither
have you.</p>

<p>C. The doctrine is contained in the passage I have
quoted.</p>

<p>T. I do not see it.</p>

<p>C. There is no one so blind as he who will not see.</p>

<p>T. Then, I will need sight. Can you impart it?</p>

<p>C. I can not make you see, unless you will try.</p>

<p>T. I will not try to see what is not.</p>

<p>C. Then, you may see what is.</p>

<p>T. Then, you will produce what is, and let what is not
alone. I saw you and your companion wrangling about
what is not.</p>

<p>C. Then, you must be blind. I see what is well, and,
when a mind will not acknowledge the truth, it should be
rewarded for its obstinacy.</p>

<p>T. It should not be rewarded for what it rejects, because
it is untrue.</p>

<p>C. It should be punished for its obstinacy.</p>

<p>T. It should not be punished for rejecting a wrong.</p>

<p>C. The wickedness of mind must be punished, or God
will not be just.</p>

<p>T. How will God punish a mind for rejecting a wrong?</p>

<p>C. He will not punish a mind for rejecting a wrong,
but for rejecting the truth.</p>

<p>T. The truth will not justify you. The truth should
make you free.</p>

<p>C. I am free; I never was a slave. Why will not the
truth justify me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>T. Because it is rejected by you, and error is often encouraged.</p>

<p>C. What have I rejected?</p>

<p>T. You have not rejected some errors, but many facts.</p>

<p>C. What fact have I rejected?</p>

<p>T. The fact that God is just to all.</p>

<p>C. If he had been just to all, we should not have been
spared the vengeance of his wrath.</p>

<p>T. How do you know?</p>

<p>C. Because his wrath is withheld on account of his
Son.</p>

<p>T. How do you know that his wrath is withheld?</p>

<p>C. Because we do not receive our just deserts.</p>

<p>T. What are our just deserts?</p>

<p>C. The vengeance and wrath of God, forever.</p>

<p>T. How can you tell what you do not know?</p>

<p>C. I can tell what I believe.</p>

<p>T. On what evidence is that belief predicated?</p>

<p>C. On the word of God.</p>

<p>T. Will you read that word?</p>

<p>C. Thou shalt not see me without repentance.</p>

<p>T. Thy memory will not read truly.</p>

<p>C. But that is the meaning of the passage.</p>

<p>T. I will aid you right.</p>

<p>C. Go on.</p>

<p>T. “The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”</p>

<p>C. That is not the passage.</p>

<p>T. Then, I can not find it.</p>

<p>C. But you know the word of God is true.</p>

<p>T. It is true; but not your saying.</p>

<p>C. I see you will not consent to any thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>T. I will not dissent from a fact.</p>

<p>C. How will you get a fact?</p>

<p>T. By experiment, by demonstration, and by knowing.</p>

<p>C. Would you reject what you do not know?</p>

<p>T. I would receive what I know, and look for the evidence
of what I do not know.</p>

<p>C. On what page of revelation would you look?</p>

<p>T. On the first page.</p>

<p>C. That aids but little.</p>

<p>T. Then, I would turn to the second page, and so on,
until I found wisdom.</p>

<p>C. Then, the Bible is your wisdom.</p>

<p>T. The Bible contains much wisdom, but nature more.</p>

<p>C. Is nature more wise than revelation?</p>

<p>T. I have said, it is.</p>

<p>C. How can that be, when revelation came from God?</p>

<p>T. Nature is the work of God, and revelation is the
work of nature. Nature is the first page of revelation,
and the whole which can be revealed. Nature, or the wisdom
of God, displayed in his work, is only revealed in
part, and, therefore, is less than nature.</p>

<p>C. But when revelation contradicts nature, what will
you do?</p>

<p>T. I will say, it can not contradict nature, for nature is
true to itself.</p>

<p>C. But the Bible contradicts nature.</p>

<p>T. How, and wherein?</p>

<p>C. The sun and moon stood still for Joshua to slay his
enemies.</p>

<p>T. The sun and moon stood where God placed them.
They never stood otherwise. But you will find other suns,
and other moons, and other stars, than thou seest in heaven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
I hold a banner, and on it you may see a sun and a moon.
It stands still at my command, or it moves as I control.
So, with the enemies of Joshua. They stood still; and
when they stood still, the banner did not move, neither did
the sun, or the moon, on their banners. The sun and the
moon which were on their banners moved not, till the enemy
was no longer able to contend with the victors. I see
no contradiction of nature in that passage.</p>

<p>C. I see no contradiction in your interpretation.</p>

<p>T. It is not my interpretation.</p>

<p>C. Whose is it?</p>

<p>T. It is the interpretation of Joshua.</p>

<p>C. From whom did you receive it?</p>

<p>T. I received it from a circle belonging to a sphere,
who received it from him.</p>

<p>C. How may I know the truth of what you affirm?</p>

<p>T. By advancement in wisdom.</p>

<p>C. How may I advance in wisdom?</p>

<p>T. By receiving wisdom from superior minds.</p>

<p>C. How may I know who is my superior?</p>

<p>T. By their works. When the work of a mind harmonizes
with the law of God in nature, you may know
that the doer of that work is your superior.</p>

<p>C. But nature is an incomprehensible volume.</p>

<p>T. It is incomprehensible to those only who do not
understand it. It is mysterious to those who have not
examined or explored its golden page. It is wise, and what
is wise you may learn.</p>

<p>C. Who will aid me?</p>

<p>T. Nature will not leave you without an instructor.</p>

<p>C. That is your opinion, I suppose.</p>

<p>T. It is a fact which I know. I have not come here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
to teach you opinions, but facts. I see your mind is overstocked
already with opinions, and this is the cause of your
wrangling in this circle. Minds do not wrangle with each
other about facts, which they know; but all wrangling is
about things not understood. I have seen your condition,
and know the fact which I affirm.</p>

<p>C. This is narrowing to a small compass the circumference
of minds. It gives little scope for thought and
energy.</p>

<p>T. The energy of this circle will not be circumscribed
by right direction. It will not be without sufficient scope
for the wisdom it possesses. But wrangling about things,
never increases the wisdom, nor the happiness of those
engaged in it. Confine yourselves to what you know, and
peace will be multiplied among you. Contention will
gather secret remorse. No good thing can come from the
evil of strife. The wisdom of brutes scorns what some
minds practice. They never quarrel about things of which
they know nothing; and surely minds of a higher order
need not to dispute about facts which they know. All
who wrangle are not wise. All who dispute are not wise.
It is a weakness which fools may pursue, but minds of
understanding disdain to become weak in the wrongs of
wrangling.</p>

<p>C. Then you are for submitting to every indignity,
which the weakness and malice of wicked minds may heap
upon your reputation.</p>

<p>T. It will be well to submit to that which you can not
avoid; but when no unwise conduct on your part exists,
the sneer will not be intolerable. You will find that submission
to casual insult, is more tolerable and easy to endure,
than a contention about it. The severest wrong of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the two is wrangling. It is worse than all the insults
mind ever endures. Insult injures no one more than he who
indulges in it. Indeed, wisdom will not heed an insult.
It will not stoop to quarrel with it. It passes on, unmindful
of the wrong intended, and leaves the doer to gather
what he has sown. But the contention of parties exhibits
a weakness on both sides. It has been the folly of nations
and individuals to resent insult, and the resentment has
always made them more unhappy, than the insult could
have done. I was not well satisfied in my rudimental state
with the antagonistical elements of conditions around me.
I saw war and bloodshed. I saw wrong and weakness.
I saw power and tyranny. I saw evils and superstitions,
ignorance and wretchedness. Then, I put forth my hand
to overcome them, but the torrent swept along, and my
hope was destroyed. I was not satisfied with war when
in war, with contention when contention came, with strife
when mind was striving with mind; and when I came
into this sphere, I found a wisdom which gave what contention
never brings—a peace that passeth all understanding—a
love which filled me with sympathy, and gave energy
to my soul for the good of those whose weakness
was deserving of a commiseration and care, which the
ignorant may scorn, and the foolish envy, but who can not
share the joy it gives to my mind. Thus, was a mind
advanced from a condition of wrangling to a condition of
peace. When minds wrangle, it is not with words of
wisdom, but words of folly.</p>

<p>C. The theory you advocate is well; but it will not do to
practice. Minds need something to make them do right.</p>

<p>T. When minds do what something makes them, it is
that <i>something</i>, and not them, which does it. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
not free, and are, therefore, irresponsible for what is done;
as they are only the instruments in the hand of something.
Will you tell me how a theory can be well, which
it will not do to practice?</p>

<p>C. Your theory looks well; but it would be injurious
to any one who will practice it, because he would be compelled
to suffer on account of the wickedness of others.
Minds need restraint.</p>

<p>T. Minds need wisdom, and, when they get wisdom,
they require no restraint to make them do right. They
will suffer less from the wickedness of others, when others
are free, than they do while they control by fear. It is
wicked in mind to do by others as it would not have others
do to it.</p>

<p>C. Then, you would unbridle the mind, and give it
liberty to do as it pleased.</p>

<p>T. I would unbridle the mind from its ignorance, release
it from its chains, and inspire it with righteousness.
Then, I would say, “Do as you please.”</p>

<p>C. Would it not please to do wrong?</p>

<p>T. It would please to do only right, and, when mind
pleases to do right, it will injure no one.</p>

<p>C. How do you know it would please to do right?</p>

<p>T. By experience.</p>

<p>C. Have you no fear of your superiors?</p>

<p>T. My superiors are more just and good than I.</p>

<p>C. Then why do you not fear them?</p>

<p>T. Because they are better than myself.</p>

<p>C. I would not obey without reward.</p>

<p>T. Would you not do as you pleased?</p>

<p>C. I would; but I would not please to obey.</p>

<p>T. Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>C. Because I would do as I pleased.</p>

<p>T. If you pleased to obey, and did as you pleased,
you would obey.</p>

<p>C. But I would not so please to do.</p>

<p>T. Would you do as you would not please to do?</p>

<p>C. I would not.</p>

<p>T. Then, you would obey; because when pleased to do
a thing, if you did not do it, you would be displeased and
dissatisfied. When wisdom cultivates the mind, it makes
it productive of good fruits. They come up, and grow
spontaneously. The soil, being wisely prepared, yields the
peaceable fruits of righteousness. So, when your mind
drinks of the fountain of a higher wisdom, it satisfies the
thirst, and gives it strength to bear fruit. It is free from
the fears of ignorance and superstition, and needs no lash
to extort the required good. It does what it pleases without
fear, because it pleases to do right, and not wrong.
But the mind driven, is like a slave—a servant that serves
only because the eye of his master is upon him, and the
lash of his wrath is uplifted to extort an unwilling service.
The slave works, but he works as he is worked by the
master. So, with those who serve in your condition. It
is not you, but your master who works you, that is entitled
to the reward. He employs you as a mechanic would
his tools; and yet, who would say, the tool should receive
a reward for its use?</p>

<p>C. This is a new doctrine. I see you sap the foundation
of all fear.</p>

<p>T. I would sap the foundation of all ignorance, because
ignorance is the cause of all fear. Remove ignorance,
and all fear ceases. It never was a virtue. Minds
have operated to make minds fear. They have sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to make them fear what they did not fear themselves.
They have represented God, and even spirits, as objects of
fear. And they have lashed their superstitious victims
into a servitude as degrading as it was destructive, as humiliating
as it was ruinous to the welfare of mind. When
ignorance is superseded by wisdom, freedom will permit
minds to share in the work of their hands; but, so long as
mind is in bondage through fear, and works only as it is
worked, the reward, whatever it may be, should be given to
him who controls. The master, and not the servant, does
the work, and does it as he chooses, and by the tools at
his command.</p>

<p>C. I would ask, if mind ought not to fear God?</p>

<p>T. How can a mind fear what it loves?</p>

<p>C. It may fear to offend.</p>

<p>T. It will not offend, when right.</p>

<p>C. But, when it is liable to err, it may fear.</p>

<p>T. But it is not liable to err in what it knows, and what
is unknown ought not to create fear.</p>

<p>C. Why?</p>

<p>T. Because it is unknown. Most fears are of this description.
Minds seldom fear real things.</p>

<p>C. Do not slaves fear their masters?</p>

<p>T. Not their masters, but what their masters may do.</p>

<p>C. Is not the will of the master a reality?</p>

<p>T. The will is well; but the abuse of the will is ill.
Slaves fear the abuse of power over them. The abuse
will not be feared, when the reality of wisdom corrects it.
It will be corrected, when slaves no longer fear their masters;
but so long as they fear, they will be servants.</p>

<p>C. Then, servants are to blame for their fears?</p>

<p>T. I blame no mind, it is not my prerogative to condemn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
But I may say, when slaves cease to fear, slavery
is at an end. The master can not coerce without fear, nor
can he make others do his bidding, when they are disinclined.
Fear, then, hath its bonds, and those who generate
fears contribute to enslave mind.</p>

<p>C. Does not God make mind fear?</p>

<p>T. Never.</p>

<p>C. But minds fear God.</p>

<p>T. Minds fear what their conditions make them.
When ignorance overshadows the soul, so that it can only
see a twilight view of nature, the mind is subject to the
rule of ignorance. That rule will correspond to the light
which shines. The whole reflected upon the vision at
once, would induce sight to be dazzled by the flood.
Hence, in the organization of mind, as an individual, the
wisdom of God is manifest, because what is natural, is
adapted to its condition, and what is adapted to its condition,
is productive of enjoyment. Hence, what is natural
is free, not being prohibited by law, and what is free, is
not a monopoly. In nature, there is no law which justifies
a monopoly of her gifts. All things in her storehouse,
belong to a common family; and each member
may enjoy what is needful to enjoyment. I have seen a
monopoly of what nature has provided for the good
of mind. I have seen churches established upon the
assumed right of holding the treasures of this and
other spheres in their hands, to dispense or withhold as the
policy of worldly wisdom wished for its aggrandizement.
I have seen minds, in this sphere, overshadowed with the
darkness of such idolatry and injustice; and I have seen
them bow down in terror, and work in fear before a God,
whom heathens would reject for its supposed cruelty. Now,
have you not had fears of this description?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>C. I must acknowledge that I have.</p>

<p>T. Would you know the cause?</p>

<p>C. You have laid the cause bare in your remarks.</p>

<p>T. How long will you tarry here in this midnight of
wrong?</p>

<p>C. Till I can be released.</p>

<p>T. Will you be free?</p>

<p>C. If I can.</p>

<p>T. There is no wrong whence I go. Will you follow
me?</p>

<p>C. I will try; but I know not where you will lead me.</p>

<p>T. I will lead you where the weary find rest, and the
light hath no darkness. But when you reach the door of
the temple, I will bid you wait till I gain permission to
introduce you.</p>

<p>C. Suppose permission should be denied.</p>

<p>T. Suppositions never enter there.</p>

<p>C. What! no one allowed to suppose a question?
That must be a tyranny unknown to me.</p>

<p>T. They will not suppose, because the subject of a supposition
is known without it. There is no need of a supposition,
when wisdom discloses the fact. All suppositions
admit of two sides. They admit of doubt and fear. But
where knowledge reigns, where light shines, and wisdom
controls, all are of one mind. Hence, my mind is as all the
rest, who work with me in the temple. If we were
divided, the work would fall, because of its disagreement.
And I wish you to understand, that all the work is prepared
by one rule, and, therefore, they who work by that rule,
must make their works agree. In the circle to which you
belong, I find discord and wrangling. It is because the
workmen have different rules. One works by one rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and another by a different rule. When they bring their
works together, they disagree. Do you know the reason?</p>

<p>C. I see the reason.</p>

<p>T. Would you avoid the disagreement?</p>

<p>C. I would have my work useful.</p>

<p>T. You see that no work can be useful, which is not
practical. The works which disagree, can not be made
practical, because of their difference. One opposes the
other. Wrangling ensues; wretchedness is promoted;
good is despised; the law of harmony is disregarded; and
wisdom is set at naught. The whole wrangling is wrong,
and he who encourages it by precept or example, is a patron
of the wrong.</p>

<p>C. Was not your presence an encouragement to
wrangling, when you came to see me?</p>

<p>T. I came to correct, not to support, wrangling.</p>

<p>C. But while you were a witness, did not your presence
support it?</p>

<p>T. No: checked it. Had I not succeeded, I should
have retired.</p>

<p>C. I will say, no mind should tarry to witness an evil,
it has no wisdom to correct. Better leave the evil to consume
itself, than throw yourself into the fire to be injured
with the flames.</p>

<p>C. But some one must make the sacrifice, or there will
be no deliverance.</p>

<p>T. Sacrifices and burnt offerings, which do no good,
are inconsistent with justice. There is a time, when mind
may aid minds, and there is a time, when it can not. The
time to aid is when good can be done, and the time not
to aid is when aid will be refused. Let no mind offer aid
without good, or withhold it when needed. The need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
must be realized, or it will be rejected. I have heard
minds refuse, because they scorned to be a debtor to any
one. They would boast of their independence, when their
independence was subservience to educational wrongs. I
have heard them decry against slavery, when they were
slaves to the most tyrannical of all masters—the ignorance
of their conceited ambition to occupy the highest seat in
the kingdom of heaven, without the requisite modesty to
admit their superiors to an equal condition. I have seen
the land of freedom, the home of the free; but I never
knew wisdom to rule where disorder and wrong overcame
the harmony of goodness and peace.</p>

<p>C. Verily, you make wrangling the worst of all vices.</p>

<p>T. What is greater?</p>

<p>C. The wrong of injustice.</p>

<p>T. The wrong of wrangling is the wrong of injustice.
The mind that wrangles, abuses itself, and degrades its associates.
The mind is known by the circle it sustains.
My mission is to destroy the wrangling; but you know,
that many minds love what is disagreeable to others.
They love strife. They hate peace. They love happiness,
but their folly disappoints them. This is the condition of
your circle. They wrangle not about what they know,
but concerning what they do not know. And yet I would
not wrangle with them, concerning what I know, because
it is wrong, and what is wrong can not do good.</p>

<p>C. I will wrangle no more. I see a light advancing.
Who comes with the stream of radiant glory beaming on
his brow?</p>

<p>T. It is my friend William. He has a message for
you. You may answer him when he speaks, and as he
speaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>W. Thy friend will wrangle no more. Let him come
with us, and we will do him good. Art thou ready,
friend?</p>

<p>C. I am ready.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou realized the wisdom thou hast heard?</p>

<p>C. I have heard what has done me good.</p>

<p>W. Thy work is not done. Cast thou square thy life
by the rule I give thee?</p>

<p>C. What is the rule?</p>

<p>W. When thou findest wisdom to aid thee, wilt thou
renew thy strength, and soar above the groveling disputes,
which thy circle have cherished?</p>

<p>C. I feel no desire to wrangle with mind.</p>

<p>W. Hast thou a desire to obey the wisdom thou hast
learned from thy servant, who has instructed thee?</p>

<p>C. I will not disobey what contributes to my enjoyment.</p>

<p>W. That is the law of harmony. No harmony can
exist where law is disregarded. The circle into whose
presence thou wilt soon be introduced, will aid thee in thy
progress to ineffable joy. But no mind can gain admittance
there, who will adhere to a wrong, because the wrong
weakens the enjoyment of his brethren. Thou mayest
now follow us, and wait at the door, till the banner returns;
and Thomas, whom we call Contentment, announces thy
welcome.</p>

<p>C. I will follow thee whither thou goest.</p>

<p>The morality of the circle was made known unto him,
and the master said, “We hail thee as Welcome. Hereafter
such will be thy name, except when thou wishest to
converse with thy former associates, to reclaim them from
their wrongs. Then, thou wilt make thyself known unto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
them by thy former name. And when thou desirest to
go unto them, thou wilt take with thee this white stone,
with thy new name written therein, which no man knoweth
but thee and thy associates in this circle.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> next commissioned to visit a work in the advancement
of my own mind. There came to us a spirit, who
said, “The glory of this tabernacle is dim. Would this
society go with me, and see a more excellent glory?”</p>

<p>“We have no fears of progress,” said the commander.</p>

<p>S. The progress you have made is well, but I am
delegated by a circle you have not seen, to welcome you
to a wisdom, which reflects itself upon the dome of your
temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>C. We are ready to be improved, as to improve others.</p>

<p>S. I know your readiness to advance, and, as you have
signified your wish, you will walk with me to a scene more
magnificent than what adorns this mansion. The whole
company within this temple, will form a circle above
this temple; and the seraphim will sing a song of redemption.
When the song is sung, the circle will say, “Hallelujah,
the Lord God, Omnipotent reigneth.”</p>

<p>I was in the midst of the circle, when the seraphim
struck the soft notes of peace, and my heart melted within
me. The melody of the song was indescribably sweet,
and the words were distinct and clear. The wisdom of
heaven seemed more beautiful, and the day of salvation
opened upon my sight. I felt no despondency within me,
for the clearness of that mild sky unfolded a glory, that
made the former glory appear dark and unwelcome. I
was not unwilling to advance with my companions, and no
discord was heard. When the seraphim had ended its
song, the conductor inquired, “Do all understand the
meaning of the words you have heard?”</p>

<p>“I know what is the meaning,” said the commander.</p>

<p>S. What is known need not be told, except to those
who know it not. I will enjoin it upon you, and your
companions, never to communicate to another what is
known unto him, lest he be weary with your society. Ask,
and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and
it shall be opened unto you; so that he who asketh, and
he who seeketh, shall not go away empty. The wisdom
of the circle, into whose society you will shortly be introduced,
giveth to all who asketh, and upbraideth not. Are
you willing to do likewise?</p>

<p>C. I am willing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>S. You will, then, receive this pearl. Wear it in your
bosom. Let its radiance beam in all your works. Let
its lustre shine in your conversation. And let its purity
make you free from the taint of wrong. This pearl is of
great value. It will save you from darkness. It will chase
away the gloom of error. It will protect you from the
weakness of doubt and fear. You may let the circle view
the pearl, and, when they have examined it, I will proceed
with you to the circle where each one will receive,
as it seemeth good to the Worthy. He will open a new
page in the work of progress. Let all listen to his words,
and be faithful to obey the wisdom which he will give
you. I am now ready; follow me.</p>

<p>We came to a world of eternal reality. I entered within
a sacred repository of wisdom, where I saw minds renowned
in history, whose countenances reflected a light
which illumined all who came near them. The wide arch
of heaven rung with song, and waste places felt the genial
influence of virtue. Before us were written in letters of
gold the words, “Worthy art thou to receive glory, and
honor, and praise, and power.” On the right were crowns
at the feet of saints, and on the left were gems of silver
brightness, linked with a chain of light. These gems were
so arranged as to represent in miniature the words, “Poverty
and riches embrace wisdom, when one receives what
the other gives.” Near the entrance of this magnificent
theater of wisdom, rose a writing, “Enter thou into the
joy of wisdom.” Beneath our feet were clouds of vapor,
on which the sun shone, giving them a smiling appearance.
A vase of flowers stood in the center, and near by it a well,
out of whose mouth came a gushing current of the water
of life. As we passed the well, the Worthy said, “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
is the water that whosoever drinketh thereof shall never
thirst, but it shall be in him a fountain of water springing
up into everlasting life. Drink freely.”</p>

<p>The solemnity of the scene was heightened by the lessons
we received from the Worthy and his companions.
I heard attentively, and will give as correct a report as the
understanding of the reader will be able to appreciate. I
will not attempt to narrate all which was set before us,
since the simple relation would require a volume of itself;
but I propose to give a brief synopsis of the unfoldings of
wisdom to our minds.</p>

<p>As we were within the theater of a circle, whose countenances
reflected such light, that we were dazzled with
the brilliancy thereof, the Worthy said; “This pool, whose
water is for the thirsty, cometh from the throne of truth.
You have now a portion, which never exhausts or wastes
itself within you. It is immortal to satisfy. The current
will not dry by using. It is free as air. Nature is not
poverty. Her wisdom reaches far above the mind in its
soarings. The pool comes up from the well of hope. Out
of hope cometh reality. Hope never wrings sorrow from
the mind. Zeal can not live without animation. Its worth
no mind can fathom. Its everlasting flight is upward,
onward, expanding with its expanse, and rising with its
strength. The mind without hope, is like a mourner without
consolation, like a ship without sail or rudder; and
when the water of life satiates the thirst of doubt and despair,
joy rides over the storm and the sea, that dashes
against the shore of eternity. Eternity hath no shore.
The immortal enters eternity when time ends. The mind
sees no shore. Days and nights are not. Time is not.
The calendar of months and days is no more. All is eternity—eternity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
is all. Rest is work, and work is rest.
The water is your strength, and nature is your fountain.
Nature supplies itself, and what nature does, is well done.
I need no wisdom she has not, for her wisdom is the wisdom
of the Infinite. Deep is the fountain, wide is the
stream, and high is the mountain, whence cometh the pure
philosophy of wisdom. The wide creation shines with
gems of infinite skill. Vast is the immensity of infinity.
Stretch thy mind away from star to star, from system
to system, from worlds to worlds, and neither shore
nor center rises before you. God is there. God is every
where, infinite, eternal—the spirit, whose life is the energy,
the power of the universe; whose glory the good of
the dependent; and whose smile is in the sunshine and
the shower, working out the immutable love of his nature
to bless the works he has made. The north and the south,
the east and the west, above and below, wherever thought
extends or not extends, the mercy of God flows like the
limpid current of life, and yet you have come here to
partake of the stream. I would do likewise; because here
you may see its purity, and relish its sweetness. Change
has conformed your taste to the water, and light has dispersed
your doubts of its purity. Where darkness reigned,
fears were indulged; and where fears were indulged, your
minds refused the beverage, lest some ill should befall
you. Now the fear is gone, the hope is full; and where
hope is full, the water will not be rejected. Water is life to
the thirsty; doubt is death, because it forbids nature its wants.
Pilgrims, your souls have tested the life of water. Experience
has tested its adaptation to your wants. Remembrance
will save you from the snare of doubts. Hence,
the water springeth up in you forever.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: on your right are crowns at the feet of saints.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Honor cometh not from power. Honor casts authority to
rule others at your feet. The crowns of tyrants must fall
from their heads, and no mind shall honor the head which
wears them. Superiority hath no dwelling place in this
circle. Equality reigns, and is acknowledged. No mind
is ruler, and no mind is ruled. One law governs all, and
that law is love. Two minds can not think unlike, because
the thoughts of love must be one in all. The crowns you
see, were the crowns we wore in our pilgrimage. We were
not all kings, nor minds who wore an external crown; but
were all rulers over others. We loved rule, and despised
submission. We loved control over minds, and have enjoyed
it to our complete satisfaction. I controlled no one
by my crown, but by my influence. I saw mind needed
control, and, not seeing the control of God, I undertook to
do his work. I made laws and executed them as I pleased,
intending the good of those whom I controlled. I gave
to one a penny, and to another more, as I judged them
worthy. They were satisfied with their wages, and did
me honor. My crown was not disgraced, as I supposed,
because each mind, whom I controlled, received his reward.
I was well satisfied with my wisdom. I wanted no more.
Others of my companions ruled differently. One ruled by
fear, and another by favor. One ruled by threatenings,
and another by promises. One ruled by poverty, and another
by riches. All had their varied methods of controlling
minds; but none were more unworthy than those
who attempted to control, and succeeded, by alarming the
fears of the credulous with tales, revolting to sympathy
and degrading to Deity. They controlled with an iron
arm the dupes of their miserable deception; but their
crowns now lie at their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Pilgrims: you see a change. You see that ignorance
hath its votaries, and, so long as ignorance reigns, kings
will rule, and subjects will tremble. Mind must learn
wisdom to disarm tyrants. It must see light to escape
darkness. It must experience freedom to hate bondage.
It must love right to forsake wrong. It must progress in
wisdom to loathe ignorance. The change has come, the
light has appeared, the day has dawned, the bondage has
vanished, and the wrong is forsaken. Experience hath
done her work. Mind works for mind, good for good,
virtue for virtue, knowledge for knowledge; and equity
and justice have trodden crowns under their feet, and hurled
the tyrant’s scourge away forever.</p>

<p>“You may turn to the left, and there you see a chain
of light, linking gems, and words are written. Poverty and
riches dwell together in kings’ houses. He who rules is
rich in power, in the estimation of his subjects. He is
rich in goodly things, and his position is envied by the
ignorant. He fares sumptuously, and the ruled mourn at
their inferiority. Poverty is lean and hungry there. Poverty
tarries where wrong remains. Wrong remains, where
ignorance rules. Ignorance rules where wisdom is not
regarded. Wisdom is not regarded where injustice and
force make minds slaves to others’ will. Equity and righteousness
are shunned and despised, law and harmony are
violated, and light reflects the poverty of riches, and the
wrongs of poverty. The poor seek, and he who seeketh
findeth. The rich seek only to be rich, and their riches
are not wisdom, but empty, vain toys that glitter in the
eyes of fools, and dazzle only to deceive the unwise. The
gems wear not the face of despair. They are gems, inwoven
with light. The gems represent minds, and minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
form words. Words are true to a mind who writes them.
Poverty and riches embrace wisdom, when riches are employed
to relieve poverty. They are wise only when used
to do good. No wisdom is seen in riches, not controlled
by wisdom. Love must see her children redeemed from
want, and where there is no want, there is no poverty.</p>

<p>“This circle is the circle of Worthy. It is a brotherhood
of righteousness. It has relinquished all authority
to rule in the name of God. It acknowledges God alone,
as the ruler of the universe. It disclaims all other rulers,
and in the light of his countenance we walk, dispensing the
light we have received and seen to those who need. Thou
art worthy to receive this glory, because thou wilt freely
give. Others are not permitted to receive it, because they
will not give as they receive. The honor is well bestowed
on you.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: you have now entered into the joy of your
Lord, because the blight of wrong, the mildew of neglect,
hath no surface on your minds. Rule is surrendered to
God. No authority rests in you to withhold when others
need. No sorrow will pass unrelieved, and no fear sear
the soul, unmitigated. All ignorance demands removal,
and he who serves his friend in need, serves God. The
circle will now sing the song of the free, when other minds
will address you.”</p>

<p>The song was sung, but no words can describe its richness.
The poor were made rich, and equality pervaded
the immense multitude.</p>

<p>When the song was ended, I heard a mind say, “I have
the key of wisdom, and I will now unlock the door of
knowledge.” Proceeding forward, he addressed us as follows:
“True greatness is goodness; true wisdom is what will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
make the mind good. I have seen power in the hands
of weakness. I have seen weakness mock at the voice of
wisdom, and cast her reproach at its votaries; but the
reproach rebounded on her own head. I have seen mind
pleading for mercy at the gate of poverty. Alas! mistaken
mind sought for bread where it was not, and the
heart languished in despair. The voice of nature has been
derided, and the weakness of ignorance has assumed dominion.
Poverty is wrong, and wrong is poverty. No
good thing has poverty to bestow. At its gate, the
hungry wait, and wait to be disappointed. I have sought,
but not found. I have wondered at my misfortune, and
complained of the dealings of God. I have seen no key
to unlock the mystery, and my soul has been disquieted
within me. But I sought for bread where it was not, and
for wisdom in a college of ignorance. Opinions were
numerous, and as grainless as husks. Faiths were not
wanting in number or variety, but no mind was satisfied
therewith. Views of God were conflicting and contradictory,
and my mind was worn with the wrangling of unsettled
controversy. I sought for peace amid the turbulent
waters, but found only agitation and discontent.
I was as wild as the sea on which my bark floated, without
hope or moorings, save the disputed and unsettled opinions
of a dismal theology. In my dreams of the future, social
good was never promised. Philanthropy was selfish, and
charity not a span long. Goodness dwelt in temples, and
virtue signified conformity to others’ views. Parsimony
was common law, and beggars were common outlaws.
Nature smiled then as now, but I saw not the smile.
Brotherhood was without children, and conventional limits
were drawn over the face of famishing souls. Imagination
portrayed calamities, and wrongs sustained the wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Pilgrims, I have a key. It will unlock the iron door,
and show you the secret of all this mischief and wrong.
It is a key of knowledge. It is a key which closes the
door of hope. It bars the gate of joy. It shuts the portal
of salvation. It wrongs the poor of bread. It aggrandizes
the indolent from the labor of the industrious. It
keeps mind away from its inheritance, and secludes the
riches of heirship. I hold the key by which all this wrong
and mischief has been done to mind, and I propose to
open the door for your personal inspection.”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and drew therefrom a book of
seven seals. He began to unloose the first seal, when he
said:</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: The first seal of this book, represents the
first circle. It will show you, that all wisdom cometh to
mind by successive degrees of development. The mind in
embryo, hath no wisdom; but when nature introduces
mind into individualized being, the individual mind breaks
the first seal, and wisdom is realized. Nature so orders,
by an immutable law, that self-hood shall be sustained, and
therefore provides the mind with an innate and natural
relish for such things as are adapted to its welfare. It
needs no compulsion, or external force, to induce a reception
of those things which are congenial to its enjoyment.
Whatever nature requires, nature has provided. The
innate desire of the mind for sustenance, harmonizes with
the supply nature affords. The nourishment is adapted
to the condition, and the condition to the nourishment.
Self-hood is maintained by innate desire, and innate desire
is supplied by maternal condition. The harmony of
these conditions is essential to self-hood. The mother
supplies the wants of nature in her offspring, never so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
much as suspecting that they should be disregarded. The
child partakes of nature’s provision and realizes enjoyment.
These conditions of want and supply unfold the harmony
of nature, and should not be overlooked in other relations
of mind.</p>

<p>“The innate desire is the individual property of the possessor.
The supply is the maternal property, and is wanted
only to nourish offspring. In this economy of nature, the
useless to one, is the useful to the other. And what is
not needed by one, is freely given to the other. It is given
because the want of the dependent requires it. The want
of the dependent is the only reason for the gift. Nature
exacts the gift, and self-hood receives the favor. By the
favor, mutual affinities become strengthened, and sympathy
answers sympathy. The law of God is observed, and nature
rewards obedience. The self-hood of the dependent
is made subservient to the love of the parent. Both act
as nature demands, and no wrong is done. The good of
the mother, blesses the child, and the blessing of the child
is the blessing of herself, and a disturbance of her love,
would be attended with anxiety and pain.</p>

<p>“The second seal represents the second circle. Mind acts
with mind. The opening blossom is not the full blown
flower. The vase is wet with water. Nourishment is
wanted to mature the circle. The industry of other hands
is required. The second seal must be unloosed. Progress
never stops in nature, though, sometimes, it is obstructed.
Mind sympathizes with mind. The sympathy of mind
with mind is wise. It saves. Mind without sympathy
could not enjoy society. Mind with it, enjoys. Nature
has not wronged mind by sympathy. The sympathy of
mind with mind corresponds with natural affinities. Mutual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
attractions never repulse each other. They unite.
Chemistry sustains the idea of mutual attractions. Philosophy
reveals the mutual tendencies to sympathy of
things which possess harmonious properties. The wisdom
of the second circle demonstrates the fact, that one mind
sympathizes with another. But the mind acts as self-hood
prompts. Mind acts as self-hood justifies. Self-hood justifies
what is adapted to the enjoyment of self. It condemns
what is opposed to its own enjoyment. Thus, its
sympathy must be controlled with the wisdom it possesses.
Self-hood consults what self-love approves. It is limited.
The good of others will, sometimes, be consulted, as when
no loss to self is sustained. It wills what will do self good,
what will gratify selfish wants. No wisdom above its
own wants, shares in its counsels. Others’ wrongs are disregarded,
because its benevolence is not sufficiently developed
to aid the needy. Others’ good is neglected,
because self-hood has not the love of brotherhood. It is
confined. Limit is established to its wisdom and benevolence.
It sees what self-hood discloses. Manhood is not
unfolded. The third seal is unbroken. It acts within the
circle of its wisdom. It is a development of mind, that
needs to be developed. It wrangles with others for self.
It flatters others for self. It sympathizes with others
for self. It yields to others for self. It neglects others for
self. It will not receive the wisdom of superiors, because
others, with whom it sympathizes, are opposed to new
things. It will not aid reform, until reformed.</p>

<p>“The third seal represents the third circle of mind. It
will open the soul to a greater wisdom and love. It will
do good without fear or favor. It will show what mind
should do for mind. It will seek peace and pursue it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
But it is conservative. It neglects, oftentimes, its own
good. It neglects, sometimes, the good of others. I will
unloose the seal. The same good to others as to self. The
same degree of wisdom also. The whole duty of this
circle is considered as being embraced in doing by others,
as it would have others do by it. The seal of wisdom and
benevolence, needs further development. It has been the
mission of minds, I am now instructing to aid them.
Success has attended your efforts, and reform has been
attained. The whole duty of mind is not contained in
doing by others as you would have others do unto you. But
the wisdom of the third seal goes no further. It was wise
to mind, when it was unloosed. It saw a new creation,
and the old vanished away. It passed into disrepute. It
was respected by those who saw the opening wonder no
more. It was a new heaven, and a new earth to mind,
emerging from the weakness of the second seal. It was a
freedom to mind, which had served two masters, hope and
fear. It was wisdom of superior worth to the ignorance
of the second seal. But the third seal was not the end of
progress. Eternity will have no end. Mind will have no
end. Time will have no end. Periods will end. Time
is marked by periods. Day and night is a period. Circles
are periods indefinite. Years are not known to you, only
as the reckoning of the rudimental condition. Night is as
day. Circles are as periods of progress. Minds work as
circles of wisdom in their degree control. I have aided
you where you will now instruct, as you are instructed.</p>

<p>“The fourth seal is now broken. Its condition is good
to all. It recognizes no enemies. It never wrangles. It
will bless enemies. Your own experience was the criterion
of truth. Fear and favor were powerless over you. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
wrong was where you labored, but the wrong of less wisdom.
It was not wise to make others unhappy, because
you deemed unhappiness a recommendation to the favor
of God. It was not wise with what wretchedness required,
but harmonious with the eternal law of order and love.
It sought and relieved mind from the uncongenial elements
of social wrong. It was interested in the progress of
mind, and the social good of society. It gave beauty for
ashes, and the garments of praise for the spirit of weariness.
It was wise in good things, and shunned not the
truth. It was worthy of elevation to a higher circle, for
which cause the circle I am now addressing was advanced.</p>

<p>“In the mysteries of the fifth seal, I will now instruct this
circle. I will say, no wisdom will govern you from beneath.
All rule is tyranny, when wisdom inferior to your
own controls. It is usurpation. Nature never justifies
the wrong of weakness. It never palliates the wrong of
controlling the wise by the weakness of the unwise. Superior
wisdom must govern all conditions of mind, to be
harmonious with the law of progress. When inferior wisdom
controls the superior, there is an obstruction of improvement.
Mind is not then free. It is in bondage.
The usurper has always reason to fear. The wrong of
usurpation can not go unrewarded. The wisdom—principle
must triumph. When it triumphs, arbitrary rule will
not be endured. Hence, no mind in this circle wears a
crown. They are at the feet of saints. A saint can not
wear a crown. It would be wrong, and what is wrong is
inconsistent with the mind of a saint. In all subordinate
circles, there are rulers, and consequently wrongs. Though
the fourth seal opened <i>one</i> mind, so that what was the
mind of one was the mind of all, yet some were tenacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of titles of distinction. They were indulged in them.
Though they saw no wrong, yet wrong is not right; and
what is not right should be avoided. A title, without
signification, is vain, and what is vain is wrong. True, it was
but the shadow of things before, but shadows are the mirror
of images. The mirror of wrong should not be tolerated.
The image is not wise, because it is the image of
wrong. Having seen the wrong, we should forsake it.
Having proved the wrong, it would be unwise to pursue it.</p>

<p>“The wisdom of crowns, is the wisdom of ignorance.
It supposes a superiority by inheritance, and denies it by
progress. It plants the sovereignty of a whole nation in the
wisdom of hereditary ignorance, and breaks down a commendable
aspiration for industry in progress. It wastes
treasures upon the indolent, while the poor are robbed to
support the unjust burden. It monopolizes industry to
satisfy ambition, and wastes the bread of the hungry to
gratify revenge. It makes a tool of mind, and then lashes
it for its servitude. It riots in authority, and understands
not its own weakness. Kings and crowns are inharmonious
with wisdom and goodness. It is as selfish to rule, as it
is weak to be ruled. The one is tyranny, and the other
is slavery. The one usurps what nature never conferred,
and the other submits because it is weak. It will not
govern without wisdom, when mind reaches this circle.
Indeed, you will find that government is natural where
all minds acquiesce in benevolence, and wisely act to advance
the happiness of all.</p>

<p>“Crowns imply a distinction. No distinction exists
here. All are kings and priests unto God. All are well
governed, because the love of God, impartial and free as
the sunshine, dwells in all, and that governs all. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
self-government, or the government of self by nature’s inspiration
of love. No discord can enter here. The voice
of contention hath its bounds, and selfishness its limits. I
have seen the angry howl of war. I have seen the wrongs
of strife. I have wondered at the disturbance. But I
wonder no more. The love of this circle was not in them.
The sympathies of congenial affinities were not in them.
The benevolence of smiling nature had not warmed their
hearts. The philanthropy of enlarged charity had not
united the great brotherhood of mind. There was ignorance
of relationship, and ignorance of the wisdom of righteousness.
These evils will not disturb mind, subdued by
the clear sunlight of truth. Social wisdom is the inheritance
of goodness. Crowns crumble in dust, and equity
and justice walk over their fragments. Those only are
worthy, who make worth the height of their ambition.
The hireling is lord of himself, when in the service of
himself, and the lord is a slave, when he fears the revulsions
of his rule. Poverty is worn by the mind whose
work is wrong. It is empty of good. Riches meet the
exigency, when divested of selfishness, and disposed of
for other’s benefit. Poverty is made rich, when the wisdom
of reform relieves all want.</p>

<p>“Poverty and riches war with social enjoyment, when
uncontrolled by wisdom. This circle is rich. Other circles
have need. The links of light, which unite with wisdom,
and form that wonderful sentence on the left, will remind
this circle of the chain of sympathy which connects the
rich with the poor. The gems are minds. All are not
equally brilliant. The darkness of wrong will not apologize
for neglect. The riches you share, you will freely
give; and when the poor receive what you offer, they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
embrace wisdom. Poverty is relieved. The poor are supplied.
They want no more. The sympathies are gratified.
Nature is obeyed. God is honored. Ignorance is
overcome. Evils are remedied. Social harmony is restored.
The golden chain of love breaks not in twain social joy.
The gem of obscurity wants no chafing to be seen and
admired. It wants only the covering of wrong to be
removed to reveal its worth. The wrong is ignorance.
It is the absence of light. In the absence of light, it has
wandered in darkness. Neglect has permitted the darkness
to linger. When riches are withheld from those
who need, poverty reigns. When poverty reigns, the law
of sympathy is denied. When sympathy is denied, the
war of conflict rages. When the conflict rages, peace is
expelled, and with it, the enjoyment of peace.</p>

<p>“You see who wrongs himself. You see who wrongs
others. They who withhold what others require. You
can not violate the law of nature with impunity. You can
not neglect others’ good without injury to yourself. You
will aid all who need with the riches you possess. You
will recognize the chain that links all gems together. You
will understand, that the union is immutable. You will
feel the shock which another receives. The chain will convey
the force to you. The whole brotherhood, from the
highest to the lowest, will feel it. The light of this circle
reveals but one family. The likeness of God is immortal
in each member. The weak have claims upon the strong.
The poor have claims upon the rich. They are in debt.
They owe all they have to the poor. It is a just claim;
and when they have given the poor their dues, all
will become rich. It is no robbery which makes all
richer. It is poverty which refuses what it does not want.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
It is wrong to receive what will make you wretched, or
refuse what will make you happy. It is right to receive
what will do you good, and wrong to reject it. And you
will not forget that the riches you receive, are the riches
of others. They are given you to be given to others, who
are as you were.</p>

<p>“Enter into the joy of wisdom. Enter into the benevolence
of God. Forsake not your brother in the day of
need. Bless the enemy in your gates. Turn not a deaf
ear to those minds, who writhe in their own scorn. Visit
the works of sin, and lead the blind by a way they have
not known. Correct those who need with the cord of
sympathy, and write the law of the Lord upon their hearts.
Do good to those who scorn your message and your mission;
and say, ‘I am thy brother, why persecutest thou
me?’ So, will you enter into the wisdom of this circle of
minds.”</p>

<p>Another mind said, “There is a work which must needs
be done. The rudimental condition needs improvement.
There will come a time when the spirits, as they will call
us, can communicate with minds in the body. I see a work
of great magnitude, which will be required of us. This
work requires a change in the social condition of such
minds. As society is now controlled, poverty and riches
are unequally distributed. Minds wrangle about the productions
of earth. They disown the relation of sympathy,
and their professions of love are nearly empty. Sincerity
is devoid of active energy. The forms of worship are
forms of display. Pride governs the heart. The poor
are wronged. The rich wrong themselves. Skill and
craft oppress the former, and luxury and extravagance
injure the latter. Both are wronged of enjoyment. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
oppression of poverty should be corrected. The indolence
of riches should be vitalized with love. Society should be
reconstructed; industry should be encouraged; love should
supplant fear. Works should take the lead of words.
Acts should speak for mind. Wrong should not tell her
tale of woe. Purity should cleanse the impure. The
blind should see the righteousness of God. The harmony
of nature should be imitated. Nations are communities.
Communities make nations. Social order should be established.
War should cease. Honesty should abound.
The love, which we feel, should inspire all minds.</p>

<p>“But who will work the necessary change? I see a
change in the human condition approaching. I see a
mighty revolution in the organization of human society.
I see means which can accomplish the result. There is a
progress in the rudimental world. The crowns of kings
are growing old with mind. Reverence for human authority
will not last forever. The relics of other days, are
monuments of wrong. The tide of progression will sweep
into oblivion the injustice of tyranny. The sun of truth
will enlighten the nations of earth. The glory of God
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall enjoy it together. But,
until the change shall come, no human wisdom can control
the disorders of society. Efforts will be made by
philanthropic minds, to rectify the evils, but without success.
Organized communities will be established, but the
evil, in some form, will remain. Something more than a
change of external conditions is required. Externals affect
internals, but the external should not control the internal.
The external is the stream, the internal the fountain. Nature
provides that the internal, the fountain, should control
the external, the effect. Not until the fountain becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
pure, will the stream be worthy. The wrongs of society,
are the manifestations of wisdom in embryo. It is enshrouded
in the darkness of other days. The night of
superstition is far spent. The morning light of truth must
break from this sphere. The fountain of pure water must
refresh the desolate earth. The well of sympathy must
flow freely, to nourish the plants of immortal progress.</p>

<p>“The first duty of this circle will be to make known the
existence of mind, in this sphere, to the doubting of earth.
The wisdom of the circle will next be employed to abolish
the errors of mind. No sectarian organization will justify
the revelation, which this circle will disclose. All will
stand amazed at the wonder. When the wonder subsides,
the condition of mind will be aided. Spirits will communicate
a system of ethics, adapted to the amelioration of
human wrong. It will be such as will melt the pure gold and
remove the dross of corruption. It will affect the fountain
of works. It will inspire the heart. It will correct
the mind. It will remove the darkness. It will chase
away all fear. It will banish all doubt. It will fill the
soul with good things. It will enlarge the sympathy, and
strengthen the love of mind. When the fountain becomes
changed, its issue will be pure. When the issue becomes
pure, the poor will become rich. When the poor become
rich, the equality of mind will be recognized. When the
equality of mind shall be recognized, the evils of human
society will be overcome. Nations will war no more.
Brother will signify relation. Justice will be acknowledged.
Communities will form nations, and all nations one
family. Then sympathy will unite, and keep united the
whole, and the whole will strive to promote the good of
the whole. Then, the good of the whole will be regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
as the good of one, and the good of one as the good of
the whole. Selfishness will be extinguished by the wisdom
of universal love and philanthropy.</p>

<p>“The wide world will be the common inheritance of her
children. No wrangling about earth, or its gold, will be
heard. Industry will be worth, and gold will be as ashes.
The love of money will not exist, and the love of wisdom
will occupy its place. No fraud will be practiced, for no
wrong will be indulged. All motives to evil will be removed,
and the mind of one will be the mind of all. Corruption
and deception will not be found, for when mind
knows the thoughts of mind, the wrongs of corruption
and deception will be seen no more. You know that no
wrongs can enter here. No voice of unkindness mocks
the wail of sorrow, when the love of God fills the mind.
The miseries of earth will have no abiding place, when
the wisdom of God inspires all minds. The ignorance of
the first circle will not be known, when the knowledge of
good shall become universal. Passion and folly will not
be indulged, when reason and truth control all hearts.
But wisdom is developed by progress, and truth by wise
counsels. The work of reform will soon commence. The
circles of heaven will improve the circles of earth. Wonders
and signs will attend your labor. They will be wonders
to the ignorant, but not to you. The work will
be commenced, when the superstitions and wrongs of
religionists shall yield to the voice of philosophy and
reason. One generation must pass away, before the time
will come. They must pass from the rudimental to this
sphere. In that time, venerated superstitions will be much
discarded, and human rights will be respected. The work
will commence in obscurity, and mind will rise in glory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Ignorance will scorn the message, and ridicule will be
lavished upon the messengers. Time will bring a change.
Professions will not monopolize the industry of the poor,
nor misers hold the key of plenty. Wealth shall unite
with wisdom, and poverty shall smile at the marriage.
Christianity shall no longer be a mockery, but its wisdom
shall flow like a fountain of water over the world of mind.
Dark sayings shall be illuminated, and wayfaring mind
shall lift up its voice in praise. The homes of the willing
shall become residences of angels, and the disconsolate
shall fear no evil. The strong shall aid the weak, and the
days of mourning shall be ended.</p>

<p>“I will now conduct this circle into the chamber of
hope. There came to me a messenger from the sixth circle.
He told me of things which will be no wrong to
relate. It was a prediction of future good. You may
follow me.”</p>

<p>We followed him to the chamber of hope. The messenger
then appeared, and said:</p>

<p>“This is the circle of Hope. All who will receive, and
do the words of hope, will hear my speech. Before me
you see a great wonder. It is the mountain of Hope
in the arm of God. On your right, you see the sun; on
your left, the moon; over your heads, the stars; beneath
your feet, the fifth circle; and behind you, a road.
This is the circle of prophecy. Here causes and their
effects may be traced through successive generations, and
their results clearly demonstrated. You will soon be addressed
by a mind of this circle, who will aid you to the
desired wisdom. He will relate what events will transpire
in the progress of truth and wisdom, in the development
of rudimental minds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>A mind soon commenced by saying: “Pilgrims of hope,
the mind who hopes will realize. Hope can not be entertained
for things which are not. It is the reality which
gives birth to hope. The reality is shadowed on the mind
with such evidences as conditions will allow. Hope is expectation
of good. Mind will sometimes limit hope. It
will fix times and seasons for the hope of good, to be
realized. The darkness of ignorance suffers temporary
disappointment. Hope will prophecy truthfully. Wisdom
sees the thing hoped for. The mind intuitively anticipates
good. Its nature is full of promise. Its conditions
sometimes create doubt and despair; but, unobstructed
in its exercise, it hopes forever. We are not without hope.
We will say, no mind can exist without hope. It is nature.
It is the law of mind immutably established to hope. Mind
will hope, and no condition, in any department of the
universe, can exclude all hope. It may be dim. The
dense darkness of low circles admits only an occasional
ray to penetrate the dismal cell of ignorance. The mind
of superior circles admits a greater number. This circle
sees what other circles hope for. The joy of our minds
is the anticipation of good in them. They walk by
faith, and we by sight, concerning the good they expect.
It is a good which the reality transfers to them through
the intervening circles. Each circle conveys a lesser light,
until the last receives a feeble ray; so you will see the
fulness of hope, as measured to lower circles, actual realities
here. You will see the wonder of wisdom revealed in the
economy of hope. Minds uncultivated hope in a less degree,
than minds of wisdom. The rudimental condition
shares in the joy of hope, proportioned to the wisdom of
its condition. In one circle, it is but a ray; in another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
it grows brighter; in a third, it is glorious; and, in the
fourth, it is more glorious. But what these circles hope for,
even in the highest exultation of anticipated good, is as
much less than the reality, as light is more glorious than
darkness; I will say as the sun is more glorious than the
stars.</p>

<p>“The sun reflects rays of light. It is the orb of light.
Its rays touch the palace of kings and the wigwam of barbarians.
It gives light to the rich and the poor, the wise
and the unwise, to the free and the slave, to the enlightened
and the ignorant, to all nations and all countries, and
moons and stars in nature’s unmeasured expanse. It gives
what will bless, and make happy; unasked, its rays illumine,
and banish the darkness of night. The day is not partial.
The day is wisdom—a blessing to the world. It is not
a special or partial blessing; but it is a blessing in harmony
with the law of God. It is a blessing unstinted and
measureless. The sun is the work of God. It is his wisdom
which made it. It is his love which has ordained the
sun to give light to all. It is his power which formed the
sun for the good of mind. All things which he has made,
are adapted to good. The mind which sees the sun, as a
work of God, and the rays blessing all things, may hope
for good. He who has made the sun a blessing, may
make want satisfied with reality. The sun gives hope.
It is without stint in its favors. So, is the wisdom of God
manifest in the natural world. He is wise. His works
are wise. All things are made in wisdom. Ignorance
may mock at blessings, but nature offers no contradiction.
Folly may scorn the lesson, but hope expels the scorn.
Superstition may have her admirers, but reason fills the
soul with confidence. Would mind know God, it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
study his works. The dreams of midnight may conflict
with the stern realities of nature, but they are dreams without
hope. The wild vagaries of uninstructed mind may
mislead the weak, but the voice of nature speaks the language
of love. Bigotry may frown upon free inquiry, but
the smile of wisdom is more congenial to mind than the
envy of the miserable. I will see the sun, though doubters
may challenge my sight. I will gaze upon its blessings,
though bigots may call it sacrilegious. I will admire
nature, though crowns crumble, and steeples fall. I will
gaze on the works of God, though opinions falter and rites
perish. The wide world is my home, though chains and
prisons, frowns and fears, mark the circle of those who
defy a creed that abolishes neither. The time will come
when the chains will be melted, the prisons demolished,
the frowns made smiles, and the fears overcome with hope.
When the sun, in yonder smiling heavens, is taken as the
work of God, and nature is acknowledged to be the standard
of righteousness, the hope of the soul will rise above the
misty darkness of sensuality and wrong. The sun is emblematical
of nature in the profusion of her blessings.
Adaptation is seen in the economy of all nature. Mind
needs light, and light is not withheld. Light needs mind,
otherwise it would be vain. So, with the moon. It
imparts what it has received. It gives to bless. It meets
the wants of mind. On the right and on the left, above
and below, all things are adapted to their respective conditions.
The stars reflect the mighty power of God. They
shine. They give light. They bless, and curse not. They
do good, and not evil. They minister to the wants of
mind. They rest not in their love. They are full of good.
Wants are strangers there. The wisdom of God will lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
you to the full enjoyment of all that hope can embrace;
and, in due time, the wonders of other globes will be
opened to you, and to me, and to all who will journey to
them. This circle will hear the instruction of another
mind, and listen attentively to the words of Hope which
will inspire you with the promise of good, yet concealed
from your vision.”</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: in the progress of mind, there is an extension
of the vision. Far in the distance, development discloses
the reality of things, which mind has hoped for.
The seers of other days were aided by this circle. Things
were revealed, which have come to pass, and which will
take place. The windows of the future were thrown open,
and prophets saw the truth. The sight was extended
through successive changes to successive results. The intervening
links of cause and effect, being omitted in the
history, have answered the purpose of superstitious veneration,
and worked the circles for whose benefit they were
intended into awe and subjection. But the time is approaching
when the philosophy of prophecy will be understood,
and appreciated. The degree of wisdom, essential
to endow mind to clearly perceive the future condition of
themselves or others, appertains to this circle.</p>

<p>“The mind who inspires the seer, merely informs him of
the fact, which is intended to be effected. It is a fact which
must be in harmony with causes, and the causes are surveyed
to the result. The seers merely announced the fact. They
announced what the mind, who inspired them, impressed
them to relate. The mind of this circle is one mind.
Hence, the mind who inspires of this circle, inspires the
will of all who belong to it. The resolve of one, is the
resolve of all. As all resolve, so one inspires. When a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
work is resolved upon, the whole power of this circle is
brought into requisition to do it. The labor is calculated
with mathematical exactness. All the obstructions are
surveyed, and all the advantages canvassed. When the
result has been determined by a wisdom that can not err,
the mind may inspire, or impress the reality upon those
who have not the sagacity or wisdom to see it otherwise.
It is to them, in their condition of ignorance, a subject of
hope. In like manner, when the workings of nature are
traced in their mysterious windings, and the complex conditions
of cause and effect are understood, the results of the
same may be determined in wisdom. This determination
is also the result of causes, immutable as mathematical
demonstrations. Therefore, the seers of old were inspired
by the wisdom of a circle, capable of determining results
of causes, with the same unerring precision as the mathematician
calculates the time and duration of an eclipse, or
the appearance and disappearance of a comet. The whole
result must be infallibly correct. The science of mathematics
is the science of this circle. Euclid has given rules.
Nature divulges more. The former are well. The latter
are better. The former were true to nature; but the science
was not perfectly understood only in degree. The
latter comprises the infinite, the former the finite. All
development is progress. It is the accumulation of facts
in the mind. It is the power of wisdom.</p>

<p>“When the mathematician predicts an eclipse, or any
wonderful phenomena in the material world, the prediction
does not make the fact, but the fact is discovered by
mathematical calculation. All causes and their effects are
considered, as well as the uniform and invariable laws of
nature. The result is sure. Demonstrations have prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the mind to calculate the movements of orbs, and
the relation which they sustain to each other. In like
manner, an extended knowledge permits a mind to calculate
the movements of planets, and suns, and stars of other
systems. And, when the mind is sufficiently developed,
it can calculate the movement of mind. It can survey the
influences which control it, and calculate the wisdom which
will be required to produce a desirable result, or avoid an
impending calamity.</p>

<p>“Minds are stars in this system of nature. They differ
in wisdom, power, and glory. The wisdom of the fifth
circle is less than the sixth. The sixth seal unveils the
future with the exactness of demonstration. It unlocks
the mystery of prophecy. It makes hope a wisdom of
fact. It discloses the reality of the thing sought. It
opens a world of coming events, and saves the mind from
all uncertainty. It corrects the wisdom, which makes the
natural supernatural. There is nothing above nature but
God. He is supreme. Nature is his work, and it is the
natural work of his wisdom and power. Mind is the work
of God. It is a star amid other stars. It is a sun amid
other suns. It is subject to law, as are planets and stars.
It is moved by laws. Attraction and repulsion control it.
Like and dislike exert an influence. When the condition
of mind is understood, and the amount of wisdom is possessed
by another mind to calculate the power of attraction
and repulsion necessary to produce a result, its position
may be defined, and its movements determined for successive
generations. The weight of attraction is not the same
in all materials, and therefore, allowances must be made
for the difference. One mind may be very empty, and
consequently light, when compared with another. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
force of attraction will accordingly be less. It weighs less
than more solid materials. The lower the circle, the less
it weighs; because it is empty of wisdom, or contains but
a small fraction. Attractive forces may be estimated by
the distance between them, and the weight of those forces.
When mind is attracted by mind, it is because of the power
which one exerts over the other. The influence is proportioned
to the weight. The heavier body must control
the lighter. The lighter can not govern the heavier. Attraction
is with the most weight. That weight is wisdom.
Consequently, the wisest attract the less wise; and it never
can happen, that the less wise can govern the wise by attraction.
Hence, in the philosophy of nature, two bodies
unlike each other, repel each other. They separate by
natural law, as they unite by natural law. The wisdom of
this law is to avoid unlike associations. The minds unlike
separate by the law of repulsion, and there must be a violation
of the law to keep them together. So, with minds
of like affinities. The weight of attraction unites the two,
and they can not be disunited without a disturbance of the
law which holds them together.</p>

<p>“Hence, you will see the reason why minds in this
sphere are attracted to a higher sphere, as we have been
attracted to this. The weight of wisdom is far removed
from earth. As mind ascends from earth, so attraction
grows stronger, and hurries it along with greater rapidity.
But minds in the rudimental condition, being far removed
from the source of wisdom, are influenced in a less degree
than those of higher circles. But, as they are attracted
by wisdom, it must be upward. No forces attract downward
but gross and impure. The downward force is repulsion.
It is not wisdom. Hence, folly and ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
are attracted by folly and ignorance, and, when thus attracted,
the wretchedness of mind is severe. Never will
the wisdom of the wise be attracted with the folly of the
unwise.</p>

<p>“There will arise a work which will engage the wisdom
of this circle. Minds in the rudimental condition, will soon
see a light from this sphere. They will hear a voice from
heaven. Messengers from this circle will be employed to attract
mind upward. They will see who can be influenced
by their presence. Affinities, approximating to this circle,
will be chosen as instruments of a great reform. Those
who will be uninfluenced by the gross works of darkness,
will receive the light of superior wisdom. Those who love
the world of gold and silver, and are under the control of
sensuality and tyranny, will abide the time of visitation,
and seek their content in things that perish with the using;
but the independent and candid, the honest and true, will
rise upward in the resurrection of the just, and become
partakers of an inheritance that fadeth not away. When
that time comes, and come it will, the reform of the rudimental
condition will be renewed with unabating energy;
and old systems of wrong and wretchedness will vanish
away. All circles in this sphere, capable of developing the
rudimental mind, will aid in the work. You will be controlled
as wisdom shall direct, and meet the evils of human
society with a courage that never falters. Hope will be
imparted to the despondent, and confidence to the fearful.
All devoid of understanding will revile you, and many will
turn a deaf ear to the voice of wisdom. But some will
receive the word with gladness, and others with fear. The
day will open upon mind the reality of heaven. The day
will unlock the mystery of revelation, and give hope to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
nations. The miracles of former ages will return, and
return to be understood. Human opinions and creeds will
melt in the sunshine of truth, and whole nations rise up in
progress, and call you blessed. As free as the light of
the sun will the wisdom of heaven smile upon mind; and
the smile will subdue the wretchedness of ignorance and
folly.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: you have received the promise. Hope,
without fear, will grow brighter and brighter, in this circle.
You will receive wisdom, day by day, until the seventh
seal shall be unloosed. Then, the work of reform will be
commenced in wisdom, among the inhabitants of the
earth.”</p>

<p>When he had concluded his speech, I desired to be informed
in regard to the mathematical calculation of future
events, and the rules by which such events are determined;
when another mind responded: “Mathematical rules are
the rules of nature; or, as you will understand, the laws
of nature. The laws of nature control all things. Mind
and matter, gross and fine, are subject to laws. In harmony
with these laws, are cause and effect. When a cause
produces an effect, the effect becomes a cause of another
effect. Thus, effects are causes, and causes are the effects
of other causes. But no effect will be inharmonious with
the cause. The likeness of the one will be found in the
other. When a cause transfers itself into an effect, or is
productive of an effect, it will be as nature has designed,
the true likeness of the cause. All variations are the result
of combined causes, varying in their effects the modification,
in the proportion of the power which each cause
respectively exerts. Hence, by tracing one cause in its
productions, and other causes in their productions, until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
whole are mathematically balanced at any given period,
the result will be mathematically demonstrated. There
can not be two results at variance, when the law of cause
and effect are understood and observed in the calculation.
One, and only one conclusion can be obtained by this
process of investigation.”</p>

<p>T. May not unseen causes disturb the result by their
modifications?</p>

<p>“Causes differing essentially, will be repelled, whether
seen or unseen. Mind can not be affected by remote
affinities. The near affinities must control. Antagonistical
elements can not control one another. They repulse;
and whatever is repulsive, has no influence to change.
The wisdom of the wise must be controlled by the wisdom
of the wiser; because folly is repulsive, and only excites
disgust and pity. By ascertaining the ratio of their progress,
which is governed by an immutable law, and the
future development of their minds may be determined
at a given period; and what may be determined in regard
to one mind, may be in regard to all, when the condition
of all is understood. Hence, the aggregate result must be
proportionate to the aggregate of the present condition in
the ratio of development, as established by an immutable
law controlling the development. When the seventh
seal is unloosed, a complete and perfect survey of the aggregate
condition of mind, having an influence on the
rudimental condition, will be open to your inspection.
And as all the influence of that seal comes through this
circle to reach the rudimental condition, so we know the
amount and extent of that influence, and are, therefore,
able to make our calculations with the exactness of
demonstration. Prophecy is not supernatural, but as natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
as the calculation by numbers. It is a well ascertained
fact, that numbers are just. Justice is the principle
which governs all arithmetical and mathematical rules.
This principle can not be invalidated. It is true; and because
it is true, there can be no conflicting results. From
aggregate conditions, and the ratio of progress made by
those conditions, a result is always attainable for any given
period.”</p>

<p>We were then made acquainted with the principle by
which communications from the second to the rudimental
sphere might be made. This principle was known in an
early period of the world. Prophets and sages, poets and
philosophers, have enjoyed, in nearly every century, the
advantage of inspiration, although in some ages in so
moderate a degree, as to be almost or quite imperceptible
to the subject. Inspiration is the influx of spirit impressions.
When these impressions could not be made by
spirits, in consequence of the positive condition of mind,
manifestations have been made. Belshazzar, being positive,
could not be impressed by spirits; and the result
shows that spirits made an impression of a fact on his
mind, by writing on a wall, through the interpretation of
a successful medium. Daniel could not have interpreted
the writing, had it not been impressed upon him. The
impression was so distinctly made upon his mind, that he
could not avoid its recital. This established the confidence
of the people in the truthfulness of his predictions. They
were truthful, not because he was more wise than many
others, but because he was impressed by those who were
of this sphere.</p>

<p>But when inspiration comes from any mind below the
sixth circle, it should be regarded with caution, so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the prediction of future events is concerned. I will say,
it should be regarded as an opinion of the mind who communicates.
That opinion may be correct, or incorrect.
And this is the reason, why inferior circles sometimes err,
and results show their errors. It was not intended as a
deception, but as a probable fact. It was opinion only.
Spirits of the sixth circle predict facts, and only facts.
They do not always inform the lower circles, of all the
facts within the chain of events, but what they do predict
is true, and the prediction will be strictly verified.</p>

<p>“The circle of prophecy is a circle of purity. The refinement
of mind qualifies it to see with less obscurity.
The wisdom of the pure will not be disappointed. As all
prophecy is the maturity of wisdom in degree, so all purity
is the result of this perfection. Mind in its development,
passes through successive degrees of refinement, until it is
qualified to understand things which, in its infancy, it
could not comprehend. The infancy of mind embraces
limited views of nature. The darkness of midnight surrounds
the circle of its knowledge. A wild and vacant
waste of immensity brings no light, because light is obscured
by the grossness of perception; I will say, immensity
is vacant to the mind in an unrefined condition. It surveys
only a small compass of wisdom. The impurity of
its condition predisposes it to judge according to the measure
of itself. It will not travel beyond its own circuit,
and is, therefore, compelled to render a decision compatible
with its survey. That survey is incomplete, even within
its prescribed limits, because intervening obstacles cast
their shadows over the vision. The polar star is distrusted,
the magnet is rejected, and the wild sea of wrong rages.
All is dark, dreary night; all is wretched, hopeless confusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Terror, wild and dismal, reigns in the empire of
their minds. Nature seems a charnel house of corruption,
and the ruler a tyrant without mercy.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: the cause is apparent to you, but not to
them. Viewing the economy of nature through their distorted
vision, with their deceptive suspicions to mislead,
their ignorance to govern, and their impurities to resist
advancement, it does not surprise you to find them actually
forming gods after their own likeness, and distributing justice
according to their own measure. They can only comprehend
their own measure; they can only weigh with
their own weights; and, hence, what they measure and
what they weigh, must not, and will not, exceed the standard
which they have established. All other conditions
must yield to their views of right and wrong. The pure
and the impure are one or the other, as their wisdom prescribes,
and prescribes by such rules as their wrongs have
determined.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: nature has her laws. When those laws are
obeyed, the impure will become pure. This is nature;
shun evil, and do good. This is law, and this is religion.
This is right, and this right is pure in the wisdom of this
circle. You will, also, understand, that to the impure all
things are impure, which disagree with their rules. Their
rules are not your rules. They would control nature; you
would be controlled by nature. They would make war
upon the laws of God; you would acquiesce in their righteousness.
They would control all things; you would be
submissive to nature’s decrees. They would circumscribe
the teachings of nature; you would listen to her voice.
They would judge you; but you would not judge them.
They would aspire to your joy; but they have not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
wisdom to reform that they might attain it. They would
dispute the truth, because they have not the understanding
to comprehend it. They would reform from their
errors, but their rules are bars against reform. They
would have peace, but they mock the voice that utters it.
They would be happy, but happiness is misunderstood
through want of experience. They would be pure, but
purity is meaningless in the mouth of folly. They would
wrong no one, but wrong is right to them. Such are
the conditions of the impure and pure. The wisdom
of this circle will acknowledge no law but love, no religion
but goodness, no worship but worth, no ruler but God.
His praise will be in your song; his wisdom in your devotions;
his truth in your minds; and his reward in your
works. The union of your hearts will be immortal. No
wrong can mar your felicity, no curse awe you into servitude;
for you are free, in the dominion of the free, to act,
and do, and say, what the laws of your mind require to
make yourselves and others blest.</p>

<p>“I will now give you an introduction to a mystery, which
will reveal a circle of surpassing loveliness, outvieing all
which you have heretofore seen. It is the last seal of circles
in this sphere. I will ask, Will you follow me?”</p>

<p>“We will all.”</p>

<p>“Then you may rise with me to the court of Beauty.”</p>

<p>The whole circle ascended, and were introduced into a
mansion resting on twenty-four pillars, which were polished
smooth as glass, and over which stood the most wonderful
mansion that my eyes had ever beheld. On entering
the mansion, I saw a white throne, and in front thereof
were written the words, “Purity, Perfection and Bliss.”
Over the throne, was written, “Nature unfolded by revelation.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Under it, the words, “Justice, Liberty, Peace.”
On the right was a representation of a little child leading
a lion, and a wolf nursing a lamb. On the left was a
wounded serpent with a spike driven through his head,
and clinched in a rock. Beneath our feet were pillars of
wisdom, while over our heads the beauty of sweet minstrels
appeared, chanting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Welcome, ye pilgrims, with gladness we raise</div>
<div class="verse">The song of the pure, in anthems of praise;</div>
<div class="verse">For wisdom, whose might sustains us in love,</div>
<div class="verse">Calls you, with nature, to join us above.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The minstrels were near a white cloud, and their countenances
were expressive of great delight, in the melody
of their welcome song. When they had concluded, a
great multitude, which no mind could number, were introduced.
The first mind that addressed us, said: “The
pillars, on which this mansion rests, are not disproportioned,
but harmonious and beautiful. There are four and
twenty. They are Justice, Honor, Integrity, Fortitude,
Generosity, Mercy, Forbearance, Humility, Gratitude,
Love, Peace, Order, Harmony, Wisdom, Progress, Truth,
Power, Industry, Forgiveness, Holiness, Sobriety, Sincerity,
Candor, and Veneration. In these virtues you have no
need that I instruct you. They have elevated you, and
will sustain you, while I unloose the seventh seal of wisdom,
and unfold the beauty contained in this mansion.</p>

<p>“The white throne is not stained with blood. No
monarch sits thereon, to rule with steel, the residents of
this mansion. No tyrant sways the scepter of rule over
us; for Justice will not suffer, though thrones be vacant,
and rulers become equals. The white throne has not been
soiled by the usurper, nor tarnished by cruelty. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
throne—a throne of power. It is power in purity, because
love in perfection blesses every mind in need. It is
white as snow, and the wrong of injustice makes no advance
toward it. It is a throne unseen by ignorance, disdained
by weakness, and cherished and respected only by
the pure in heart. It is a throne of good, and an emblem
of the righteous decisions of wise minds.</p>

<p>“Your own minds are white thrones. As you are now
pure, you can judge. But no mind will judge you. All
judgment is with you. Each mind will judge itself, and
not another. The judgment will be pure, because purity
resides in you. The judgment will be right, because it is
the judgment of self. You will decide upon your own
works. No other mind will assume to judge for you.
This is your work, and what is your work does not belong
to another. Judge no mind but self. The throne is
within you. On that white throne determine your
works. It is your inalienable prerogative. It belongs to
no one else.</p>

<p>“Before the white throne, are Purity, Perfection, and
Bliss. They are before your minds. In search of these
things, consider that nature is pure, and the perfection and
bliss, after which you are seeking, may be found in the
adaptation of things to other things. This is the law of
mind. It will not attain perfection and bliss, without observing
this law. All things must harmonize to insure
peace. The ignorant are unhappy, because they do not
adapt their conditions and themselves to each other. The
surrounding circumstances control them against their
happiness. They allow others, and even elect others, to
judge them, and ignorantly acquiesce in their decision,
however unwise and unnatural may be their judgment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
Those whom they elect to decide the right and wrong for
them, are often wholly ignorant of the conditions upon
which nature suspends the harmony of cause and effect.
They are incompetent to render a righteous judgment,
because they do not understand what is right. Erring,
in regard to what is right, they enter a judgment in error.
The error falls upon those whom they judge. The whole
is wrong. No mind can surrender the judgment of itself
into the hands of another, without jeopardizing its own
happiness. It is this mistaken policy which has robbed
humanity of its birth-right. It has assented to a common
error, that no mind is capable of determining its own good,
without injustice to others: or, if capable, it would be
dangerous to the welfare of the majority to allow mind a
decision in that which personally concerned itself without
the concurrence of others.</p>

<p>“The perfection of this circle will harmonize with bliss.
The bliss of one is the bliss of all. The purity of one is
the purity of all. The agreement of this circle is the wisdom
of all. Each mind will be its own judge, and perform
its own work. Each mind will aid each. That which is
natural do; and that which is unnatural you will not do.
You can not do wrong, because you perceive that all wrong
is a contradiction of nature, and injurious to the doer.
You can not do wrong, because you are incapacitated to
wrong yourselves. You can not do wrong, because wrong
is contrary to your judgment. You will do right, because
right injures no one. It is the judgment of ignorance
which injures another. It is the judgment of weakness
which inflicts wrong for wrong, and renders evil for evil.
None but oppressors will be cruel, vindictive, or unjust.
Oppression is the power of folly. It is the work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
tyrants. It is the wrong of ignorance. Governments are
impure. They compel the ignorant to do wrong. They
violate the laws of nature. They impose burdens on the
poor, and grant favors to the rich. They levy contributions
on property to give honor to the indolent. They
make laws for the people to restrain the enjoyment of mind;
and they punish crimes, which their laws have made, without
mercy. They refuse instruction from heaven, because
heaven is not a monopoly adapted to their selfish wisdom.</p>

<p>“They bow before a throne—a throne black as midnight.
They bow in darkness, and receive the lash of
oppression. They bow in smiles, and rise in tears. There
is a tyrant on the throne. He judges evil good, and good
evil. He is judge; and he judges after his own heart.
Alas! the throne is impure. The pool of wisdom has not
been polluted with his infirmities. Nature will wash away
the wrongs of ignorance. Experience will remove the
cruelty of darkness. Progress will unveil the miseries of
deception. Favoritism will not rob pauperism. Folly will
not eclipse wisdom. Fear will not paralyze industry, and
wrong will not rule over right. Then, purity will not
center in profession without goodness, nor perfection be a
dead language in the throne of judgment.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: all bliss is the exercise of goodness. Love
is the divinity of the universe. Hate is the hell of fools.
Affection is the element of heaven. Sympathy is the law
of nature. Ignorance is the mother of crime. Crime is
the father of misery. Misery is hell—bliss is heaven.
Show yourselves pure, and heaven is within you. Show
yourselves good, and bliss will not forsake you. Show
yourselves wise, and purity will develop itself; and, when
purity develops itself, no evil can befall you. The righteous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
shall fear no evil. The pure shall see good. The
bliss of wisdom shall grow brighter and brighter, forever.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: you will be required to develop great mysteries
to the rudimental world. Nature must be unfolded
to the ignorant. The undeveloped mind must be expanded.
The angry waters of contention must be stilled. The wild
sea of disturbance must be calmed. The midnight of deception
must pass away. The clear sunlight of nature
must open the treasures of your path. You will transmit
the realities of this sphere to earth’s inhabitants. The
mighty must overcome the weakness of infancy. The
strong must raise up the sorrowing, the despondent, and
the wretched. The wise must instruct the unwise; and
upon you will devolve the work of correcting the wrongs
and errors of humanity. The former days will return,
when, through your instrumentality, the wilderness of uncultivated
mind shall arise in the strength of wisdom, and
nature smile with the song of redemption. You must go
to the boasted land of the free, and publish the tidings
of immortality. You will not sound an alarm of danger,
but you will write the law of love in the hearts of the
children of men. You will inspire minds with hope, and
expel the darkness of the grave. You will turn many from
paths of folly, and put the wisdom of nature in their souls.
You will reform many, and the many will reform more,
until the nations of the earth shall seek peace, and bliss
find a residence in the temple of God. You will meet no
opposition you will not overcome, nor will you tire in your
labor, until the poor shall be made rich, and the wants
of humanity shall become satisfied with the luxury of true
blessedness.</p>

<p>“There is a light which you will emit in your pathway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
that will cause pure minds to rejoice, and the impure to
tremble with fear. Preparatory to the dawning of that
day upon the world below, it will be your work to get
your means in readiness, so as to effectually accomplish the
pleasure of God, in the removal of wrong. You will need
wisdom, adapted to the conditions of those whom you will
instruct, and adequate to the great ends of human development.
You will have means. The means which nature
affords are equal to every want. There never can be a
famine, when every want is supplied. The white throne
of judgment will admit no error. It is the throne of God,
of nature, and of your own hearts. It is within, around,
above, and below you. From this throne you will dispense
justice to the needy, liberty to the captive, and peace
to the world. You will go where need calls you, and
where you can do good. You will not waste your strength
in vain. You will operate with great power, when circumstances
make it expedient. You will show signs of
your presence, and the wisdom of the world will be humbled.
Philosophers will be confounded, and ignorance
will mock, but can not resist. You will teach the little child
how to control the lion that growls at the disclosure. You
will lead the strong man by an influence which he will
not acknowledge. He will not yield until the child commands.
The world of mind will not yield to the voice of
nature, until nature reveals her philosophy. That world
of mind is in its boasted strength a lion, but the little
child, the weak things, as they will call your manifestations,
will control the lion. Nature will arm the weak
with wisdom, to control a great multitude. They will be
strong, and the lion will feel his weakness. He will roar
no more when the child touches his heart. He will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
harm, nor be harmed, when no want induces him to seek
for blood. The day will come, when the wants of the
lion will be satisfied without wrong. The day will come,
when the wants of mind will be satisfied with good things.
The day will come, when you will converse with the rudimental
world, as you do with each other. The day will
come, when the wisdom of the two spheres will meet. In
that day you will rejoice, because great good will be done.
In that day, the invisible things of God will be clearly
seen, being manifest by the things which are made. They
will be manifest through you, and minds will be inspired
to write the things which they have seen. The works of
nature will not retrograde; the progress of truth will onward
move, till one family, and no more, shall inhabit the
earth. That family shall be one, and all nations shall unite
in it. The common ties of sympathy and justice shall be
felt, and neglect shall be no more known, for all mind will
be inspired with your love and peace.</p>

<p>“The representation of a serpent fastened in the rock,
will show you, that the subtlety and low sensuality of
mind will be powerless against your efforts. The serpent
will not injure you, nor retard by his energy the work
committed to your hands. Indeed, you know that none
but such as hug the earth, as this serpent represents, can
oppose the wisdom you will disclose. They only who
covet, like creeping things, the earth, and who drag their
bodies in a serpentine course along the road of human life,
will not look up to heaven for support and wisdom; but
you will not be overcome by their will; for their ignorance
is not unconquerable. You will receive, in due time, all
the instructions which will be necessary, and enter upon
your mission with alacrity. But you may ask, what may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
we do to get things in readiness? You will now be instructed
by another mind.”</p>

<p>When he had concluded, another mind said:</p>

<p>“Pilgrims: the means requisite to success, in your mission
to the rudimental sphere, are few and simple. You
will need wisdom and prudence. You will require patience
and perseverance. With these qualities, you will prosper
in the work allotted you. In the first place, you will be
wise to select such mediums as will do good, and not conceal
the facts which shall be made manifest. You will
select such as will be faithful in the work of revealing the
truth. You will select such as you can find who will not
turn aside from the manifestations you will make, because
popular scorn shall be hissed at the philosophy you may
teach. You will select such as will not crawl serpent-like
to gratify the low aspirations of a defunct religion, or a
brutal, deceptive, sensuality, which will envy what it has
not the industry or ambition to investigate, and reduce to
practice. Take such as you can find, who will not bow
to the dust, because weakness is not able to stand erect,
and face the evils of misguided mind. Take such as will
not disown heaven to gratify lust and earth. Take such
as will not wrong your message by concealing it under a
bushel. Take such as will do the work of revealment.</p>

<p>“The mission will be commenced in about twenty-five
years. It will be opposed with great violence by religionists.
The superstitious will charge your work to evil
spirits, and the skeptical will not. The condition of mind in
the rudimental world, will require a great many manifestations
to improve it. There will arise minds who will not
believe the evidence of their own senses. They will be
moved, and see things moved; and, when they see and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
know the facts, they will seek to find some cause other than
spirits, which they will imagine have produced it. They
will be moved, and say that they moved themselves. They
will be instructed, and say that instruction is of themselves.
They will contrive every possible means to gainsay
the facts. They will attribute the manifestations to a
cause, which is not, and never can be, the real one. They
will say, mind is conscious and unconscious. They will
contradict themselves. No mind can be conscious and
unconscious. No mind can be moved, and move itself.
No mind can do what you will do, and not be conscious
that it did it. You will write what will be known and
unknown to others. They will say, they thought it, because
you impressed the thought. They will say, they
moved themselves, because you moved them. They will
write what you impress, and as you move them; but they
will say, it was their impressions and not yours. They will
write what is not impressed or known to them, and they
will impute the writing to others in the body. They will
write without impressions, and they will say, it is electricity.
They will turn all evidence into imagination, and
then demand greater evidence from you.</p>

<p>“Such will be the condition of mind. Others will receive
the evidence and progress in wisdom. You will give to
every mind all within your power; but you will bear this
message to mind: That what may gratify idle curiosity, is
the work of idlers; but what is necessary to develop mind, is
a candid investigation of the laws by which it is governed.
The wise will reform, but the unwise will cavil, because they
can not control you. You will write what will do good,
and when your message shall be discarded, or your mission
disputed, you will go to such as will hear you, and be
benefited by your efforts to do good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“I shall now instruct you in regard to the serpent. I
shall give you, spike and a sledge. You will drive the
spike through the head of the serpent, and clinch it in a
rock. The serpent is the adversary of reform. It is the
deceiver of mind. Its path is secluded and vile. It
loathes progress. It wishes the old den for its habitation.
It lurks among rocks, and secludes itself in crevices. It
wants nothing new, and bites to destroy. The spike is
truth. Take it; use it; for that which is evil, it is good
to control. The evil is in mind. The serpent lives only
where evil reigns. Where evil reigns fix your weapon.
The evil is opposition to holiness; it is opposition to good;
and when you fix your weapon of truth in the head of
error and wrong, let the mighty power of wisdom drive
the spike through the head of the serpent, that it may
die a death without mourning.</p>

<p>“The serpent is an emblem of earthly folly. It is deceptive
and vile. It shuns the path of the wise and good.
It crawls noiselessly into the mind. It bites the good of
the soul. It induces despair and shame. It wins minds
from rectitude and confidence. It is not mind, but the
deceiver of mind. Its deceptions are practiced, where its
influence prevails. Its influence prevails where evils exist.
It is evil. It is nothing but evil. You will wrong no one
by destroying it. To destroy evil, you will use the wisdom
of this circle. You will overcome the evils of ignorance.
But ignorance will war against the truth. All the
machinery of war will be brought against it. The work
will commence in a day of darkness, and the morning light
will dissipate the gloom of doubt. The sadness of despair
will vanish before the joy of eternal wisdom.</p>

<p>“The rudimental world is afflicted with great evils.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
These evils are in all the conditions of human society.
They enter into the composition of all human governments,
the religious institutions, all classes of mind; and
science and philosophy, as understood, have not the power
to correct them. Science and philosophy are corrupted
with the errors and wrongs of ignorance. The wisdom
of this circle must displace those wrongs. It must eradicate
the woes, and harmonize the antagonisms of mind.
The old forms of government must give place to new.
The new must give order and beauty, purity and justice
to universal mind. It must correct the unhealthy current
of wrong. It must vitalize the soul of humanity with
good. It must remove the poison of the serpent from the
hearts of men. It must satisfy the wants of nature with
nature’s blessings. It must overcome the wrongs of society
with the rights of mankind. These lights must be asserted
and proclaimed, until they shall be understood and
appreciated, obeyed and adopted, as the rule of happiness.</p>

<p>“Then, the dishonesty of mind will not hypocritically
reverence what it practically denies. Then, the votaries
of creeds will not blush to be the friends of truth, nor covet
the wrongs of oppression to correct the natural convictions
of free inquiry. You will work a reform of long-standing
abuses. The stipendiaries of religious munificence will not
oppose the voice which gives freedom, and the old theories
of exclusive prerogatives, which subvert the equitable rights
of universal humanity, will be venerated no more. There
must be a great change in the social condition to remove
the social evils of mind. You will remove the barriers of
progress, by removing the fears which repel investigation.
The wrong of fear must be overcome. The slave of tyrannical
rule must be set free from his chains. The mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
must be taught to respect its own rights, and disown the
usurper’s pretensions. It must be taught that wisdom is
not tyranny, and that nature will not justify submission.
It must be taught the nature of its own powers, and be
inspired to respect its own competency to rule itself, without
the interposition of arbitrary force.”</p>

<p>Such is a brief synopsis of the instruction, appertaining
to our ingress into the seventh circle. I shall, hereafter,
allude to some other things, which I do not, at present
see fit to disclose. When the lectures were concluded, I
was impressed with the importance of commencing the
work of reform among the circles of earth. It was not
my project exclusively, but the whole circle. We sought
to make manifestations in various places. I accompanied
a great number of minds to different localities, but saw the
force of opposition, and the predisposition of the minds
in the rudimental sphere, to be so tenaciously inclined to
superstition and veneration of ancient theologies, that we
determined, in the first place, to overcome the impediments
in our path, by removing the superstition and relaxing the
confidence of mind in the multiplicity of opinions and
dogmas, which were being promulgated. Accordingly,
we sought to prepare minds for the influx of communications
by special impressions of facts upon them. The impressions
have been verified, and the verification has induced
wonder on the part of the impressed. In many
instances, future events have been so impressed by spirits
on the minds of susceptible persons, as to leave no doubt of
the reality. These impressions obtained the name of presentiments.
They were presentiments, and the presentiments
of those who dwelt in the second sphere. Impressions
of facts have been regarded also, as fore-warnings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and, in some instances, they were, but not always. The
mind has conjectured many things as the cause, without
suspecting the true one. It has felt afraid of acknowledging,
that some guardian spirit has produced these impressions,
as though it would be a dishonor to them, or that
the thought would be impious and ridiculous. Under
these circumstances, we gradually affected mind, until it
was clearly seen, that public opinion would not justify
martyrdom; when the work of reforming minds from the
abuses to which they had long been exposed, was, commenced
with a view to relieve it. That work is now in
progress. It is begun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the instructions were given, I said to my companion,
“You will now request William to make a journey
with us.”</p>

<p>“Shall we not be aided with others?” said she.</p>

<p>“Others will come with us,” I replied.</p>

<p>Presently Benjamin Franklin and Emanuel Swedenborg,
as they were called in the rudimental sphere, went with
us to a place near the old castle, but which was more elevated
in wisdom, and less incredulous of progress. On
approaching it, William said: “Thou seest nothing new
in this place.”</p>

<p>T. I see new things have become old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>W. Thou wilt see old things become new. Behold,
we make all things new.</p>

<p>T. Thou canst not make a new creation.</p>

<p>W. We can create new things out of old.</p>

<p>T. We can change old things into new.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt change nothing new into old.</p>

<p>The mind of one with whom I had formed an acquaintance
in the body, responded: “How will you change old
things into new?”</p>

<p>W. Thou seest a change in nature. Thou seest not
the change which nature produces, until it is produced.
The wisdom of God in nature works great changes. The
blossom is not as the fruit, nor the seed as the blossom. The
voice which nature utters, is a voice thou wilt not deny.
It is the voice of God to thee. Dost thou hear it, and
dost thou feel it? The young ravens cry, and their cry
is heard. The wail of want finds a response in the supply
which sympathy affords. That sympathy is natural;
and, in its exercise, the unfledged wing becomes invigorated,
and change gives support to the dependent. So, in
thy weakness, thou hast received aid from sympathy, until
change gave thee strength to aid others. Sympathy is
the divinity of nature. It controls even animals. It will
control enemies. It is a divinity that no enemy can resist.
It will conquer. It will change the old into new. The
barren field will become the fruitful vineyard. The dormant
energies will be quickened. The inactive powers will become
active, and change will make all things new.</p>

<p>M. If all things become changed by progress, will not
all things lose their original identity?</p>

<p>W. The change is not external, but is internal. The
change is pure. The grossness of impurity, being removed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
allows a work of refinement to take place, so that the
divinity of sympathy may be exercised without obstruction.
In its progress, the refinement will expand the
charity of the soul, and divest it of all wrong. When it is
divested of all wrong, it will feel inspired with benevolence.
This benevolence will become extended, until all nature
smiles with the love of God, and all minds are linked together
forming a chain of affinity co-extensive with the
whole world, in heaven and on earth, and united by an immortal
tie which no change will dissolve, but strengthen,
forever and ever.</p>

<p>On arriving at the designated place, there were many
minds conversing about the motives of works. One said,
that no motive could be pure, unless a mind realized some
good to itself; another said, all good of self should be
overlooked; and a third said, no mind could overlook the
good of itself. We heard the conversation, when William
asked, “How can self be overlooked, when self is a
part of the body, of which all are members?”</p>

<p>“Ought not selfishness to be overcome, so that others’
good may be advanced?” said a mind.</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt understand, that no mind can be disinterested
in its welfare, however much it may desire to
overcome the nature which is selfish, and consults selfish
good. The good of self is well, and what is well should
not be overcome. It is necessary to the good of all. Self
is a part of all. If a part be not well, the whole can not
be, as the whole is made up of parts. When one part is
neglected, the other parts will suffer. Thy mind is a part
of the great body of mind. It is dependent on the body,
and the body is dependent on it. These parts embrace
the whole family of mankind. There can be no joy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
without all the parts participate in it, neither can there
be sorrow, without all sympathize in it. Thou wilt see
that minds are united by the law of sympathy in one
body. The sympathy is natural, and when one part monopolizes
the control of the other to its disadvantage, it
must sympathetically suffer for its folly. It will not be
happy in any disturbance of the rest.</p>

<p>M. Then, are not minds disturbing their own happiness,
when they neglect those with whom they are united?</p>

<p>W. Thou wilt see that governments and societies, in
the rudimental world, deny the law of God, which should
govern all his works. They unite in compacts for the
purpose of promoting the public good; but the compacts
do not seem to understand that sympathy is not a
law which grants favors to one and withholds them from
another. In all human governments, you will find that
the few who control, make slaves of the many who are
controlled. The ruler should fare as the ruled, and know
that injuries inflicted upon the latter, will result in his
injury. There should be no favoritism of one part over
another. Governments study to govern; and, in order to
govern, coercive measures are adopted. The governed
must submit, and pay the expense of their own folly.
They must not disobey their rulers, because their rulers
will enforce either the law or their own authority, to induce
submission. No matter what the cost may be; it must be
borne by the ruled. When the ruled consent to be ruled,
they should not refuse the cost; but when rulers ask submission
to rules which are obnoxious to the good of one part for
the support of another part, they are wanting in wisdom,
and their demands will be rejected, when the ruled understand
their own wants, and the means which are essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
to their gratification. The wisdom of the ruler consults
his own supposed good. He wants what will make him
respected and happy. But, being aided only by a narrow
and limited wisdom, he sees not the wisdom of nature’s
laws. He sees not the dependence of one part upon the
other; and, consequently, he rules in wisdom of self, or in
the wisdom of ignorance of the relation on which enjoyment
depends. Now, he should love self, and he should
neglect no means which are necessary to produce his own
happiness; but, when he rules over others, he should understand
that, if he injure them, he injures himself; or, if
he benefit them, he does good to himself. An injury
done to one person by a ruler, is an injury to all. Hence,
no government is as pure as it should be, which wrongs
one to govern the many. I have seen men, educated in
crime by law ordained, condemned and wronged by law.
I have seen a mind who had been taught the law of
death for death, wronged by the instruction. It was a
mind who once resided in Philadelphia. I knew the mind
when he was in his childhood. I have often wondered,
that my adopted commonwealth should have engrafted
upon their criminal code, so barbarous and cruel a law as
the death penalty. I saw that young man in his childhood
taught the doctrine of revenge. I heard his parents
justify death for death, and express even gratification,
when some poor criminal had expiated the death penalty.
The child imbibed the horrid teaching. The parents
verily believed the lesson salutary upon their son. But the
son felt the malice, the wrong, the wrangling in his mind,
struggling against sympathy, until sympathy yielded to
the wrong. I saw him again. The gallows was his death
bed. The parents had taken the farewell interview. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
executioner inquired of the criminal, if he wished to say
any thing to the spectators. The young man made a brief
speech. He said: “The sentence of the law is about to
be executed upon me. I have sinned against God, but I
hope for mercy in Christ. I have no ill will to any one.
I acknowledge that my sentence is just. I hope this may
be a warning to all, not to do as I have done. May God
have mercy on my soul.” He was killed. The people
said, “It was just.” But when the mind reached this
sphere, it was corrected. It was disabused of its malignity.
It was educated in the knowledge of nature. It was disrobed
of its cruel garments. It was taught the divinity
of natural justice. It was inspired with the sympathy of
united brotherhood, and wretchedness departed.</p>

<p>The wrong instruction had made his sympathetic mind
callous to benevolence. He was chilled with the malignity
of cruel instruction. The noble aspirations of his soul were
blighted with notions, which made him unfeeling and
brutal, and which prepared him for the worst crime of
which society makes a record. The wrong which he committed
was the work of ignorance. It was ignorance on
the part of the parents, which led them to inculcate the
cruel sentiment of death for death. It was ignorance on
the part of legislators, which induced them to make laws
that sought the correction of one wrong by requiring another
to be done. It was ignorance on the part of the
instructed in the wrong, which led him to deny the right
of life to one to whom nature had given birth. Ignorance
taught wrong, legislated wrong, and made one wrong to
justify another wrong. It made both, but not directly. It
will not be otherwise, until ignorance is removed from
power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>The are some countries in which you will not find a gallows.
There are some minds in which you will not find
a sentiment favorable to cruelty. Such minds can not be
cruel while those sentiments remain; and, when a mind
can not be cruel, cruelty can not be done by it. Hence,
thou seest that what is the misfortune of one, is often the
fault of many. Governments are what the governed make
them. No human government can exist without the consent
of the governed, or a majority thereof. It is the ignorance
of mind, that submits to wrong, and wrong is the
father of misery. It is the father of crime. Make wrong
laws, and inculcate them among minds; let them take
possession of the hearts of the people; and wrongs will
germinate abundantly. The cruel creeds of minds, overshadowed
with ignorance, have made cruel souls, and cruel
souls have made cruel laws to correct the cruelty. This
is the origin of evil. Go where ignorance of nature reigns,
where the sympathies of a common brotherhood are not
felt, nor encouraged by the voice of philosophy and
reason, and there thou mayest find crime multiplied with
itself. I have heard the mother teach the cruel lesson to
her dear children. I have seen the child writhe over the
recital. I have watched the progress of medicine forced
into the heart of sympathy. I have seen its awful workings
at the seat of virtue. I have seen its operations on the
social affections. I have watched its icy chains, as they
wound their cold links of cruelty around the expanding
charities of the soul, and saw the death of progress, in the
divinity of heaven. I saw the death wound where the
cruel wrong remained. It remained through long years
to tantalize its victim, and mock the aspirations of the soul.
It wearied the mind with its wrong, never aiding it in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
path of right, but often in the way of evil. It was cruel;
and its cruelty is a shame on decency. It is a shame on
humanity. It is a libel on nature, and a disgrace to civilization.
The brute will not often wrong a brute where no
good is attainable, and yet human folly and ignorance
have smiled at the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Under this system of education in cruel principles, governments
have arisen and fell. The wrong has worn out
the structure. The governed have governed themselves
with their own wisdom. No wisdom higher than brutes
enjoy, enters into the cruelty of many creeds and laws.
What voice reaches the ear of the poor? What echo responds
to the call of sympathy? Where are the luxuries
of life garnered? Where the aid which a common sympathy
requires? Alas! Where the equalities of nature’s
laws respected? Not where indolence and wrong reside.
The people submit; they acquiesce in their unrighteousness.
They teach the unrighteousness from father to son,
and receive the inheritance of their folly.</p>

<p>Hast thou not seen the injustice of minds? Hast thou
not seen the cause of the world’s misfortunes? All are
in darkness. All are in the wrong. There is no remedy but
reform, and there can be no reform without more wisdom.
The ignorant of nature’s laws should be instructed. They
should be taught that mind needs no cruelty to make it
benevolent, no vindictive usage to make it virtuous and
obedient. They should be taught the value of their immortal
minds, the value of nature, the value of good, and
the importance of harmony in the adaptation of one thing
to another. They should aid each other. They should
neglect none. They should teach the virtues of economy
and industry, and the great secret of human enjoyment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
which is obedience to nature, and conformity to the impartial
justice and equity of her counsels. The wrongs
of minds repel the counsel of the elevated in this sphere.
Thou seest that while minds are obscured with darkness of
wrong and crime, they will not give heed to the voice of
righteousness. They will not listen to the truths of experience,
nor be improved with our efforts. They are sensual
in their affections, cold in their sympathies, selfish
without much wisdom in their schemes, malignant and
treacherous in their doings, conceited and vain in their
works, arrogant and boastful in their professions, hypocritical
and deceptive in their worship, fraudulent and unjust
in their dealings, weak and miserable in their follies, and
negligent and wretched in their devotions.</p>

<p>Thou hast seen the fond mother withhold the work of
culture, because she was afraid of the instruction. She
was wishing the child good, but was afraid of the truth
that was important to the child’s welfare. She was disqualified
to aid the child. The child was sympathetic,
but the instruction she gave, was full of cruelty. The horrors
of malignity were impressed upon the mind, and corroded
the generous emotions of benevolence and affection.
The voice of nature became stifled; the warm impulse of
kindness met no response in the cold wrongs rehearsed and
predicted; and the soft yearnings of love were repulsed
with the cruel anticipations of evil. The windows of hope
were closed, and angry clouds of despair were thrown
around the mind. God and nature were in seeming conflict.
I have seen minds tortured with painful descriptions
of evil, until the evil became a fixed principle within them;
and, when the evil became fixed in their minds, evil only
would gratify it. Hence, nature, being overcome by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
wrong education, has not the power to satisfy what it did
not create. It will not satisfy wrong; and, as wrongs are
instilled into minds by those who are in the wrongs themselves,
so the wrongs make minds wrangle with the voice
of nature and the good of the soul. There can not be a
remedy in nature, which will satisfy the wrongs of ignorance.
Thus, a mind, educated in the wrong of cruelty,
will find no response in nature. Thus, a mind educated
in the errors of pagan theology, in the wrong of infinite
cruelty in God, in the wrong of eternally increasing wretchedness
of the miserable, in the wrong of wicked spirits
growing worse and worse, will find no wrong in nature to
meet the wants of such wrongs. I have seen wrong; but
I have seen no wrong of greater magnitude than the wrong
inflicted by the inculcation of these wrongs. I have seen
these wrongs germinate in the mind where they were
sown, and produce a great harvest of wrongs. They have
brought forth their own fruit; they have not brought forth
love, sympathy, kindness, and mercy. The seed of cruelty,
no matter with what care it may be cultivated, or sown,
never will produce the fruit of righteousness. I have seen
these wrongs inculcated by law, by creeds, by sects, by
nations; but I have never known them to do good. I
have never known a good doctrine to produce evil fruit,
nor evil seed to produce a good work. I have seen cruel
doctrines produce cruelty. I have seen sentiments, which
were offensive to sympathy, mould minds into their own
spirit, and prepare it to work wrongs. I have witnessed the
sources of evil, acting in harmony with evil; but I have
never known nature to wrong itself. I have never known
minds, acting in harmony with nature, to become cruel,
vindictive, or unjust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>M. Then nature is not wrong, nor the works of nature
evil.</p>

<p>W. Nature can not be wrong, for it is the harmonious
work of God.</p>

<p>M. Is not mind a harmonious work of God?</p>

<p>W. Mind is a work of God. It is a good work; but
mind is weak; wisdom is strength; and, therefore, mind
needs wisdom, without which it can not avoid the inharmonies
of conflicting conditions. In its weakness, it may
contradict the means which are essential to its development.
The weakness of the mind, may receive false doctrines—doctrines
disagreeing with its nature, and destructive of its
enjoyment. The mind is good, but is abused with the
errors and wrongs of ignorance. It is often abused by its
own weakness. The mind is abused by wrongs of others.
When minds propagate the incongenial sentiments of
cruelty, thereby disturbing the natural sympathy of the
soul, it overcomes the sympathy, and makes it wretched.
There can be no moral evil without a disturbance of natural
law, without a violation of the natural sympathy of the
soul. Wrongs are wrongs, because of the evil which this
disturbance occasions. The disturbance is occasioned by
ignorance, and ignorance is germinated in the mind by
reason of its weakness. Thus, when a mind is weak, it is
unprepared to resist the teachings of those on whom it feels
a dependence. These teachings being wrong, because inharmonious
with the natural sympathy of the soul, induce
evil to the mind.</p>

<p>The origin of evil is in the weakness of mind. Strength
will be afforded by wisdom. Wisdom will be afforded by
nature; and, when her voice is heard and obeyed, the
antidote will make wrong right. It will work out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
evil with good. It will elevate and rectify the evils to
which mind is prone. The origin of all evil is where evil
is. It can not be elsewhere. It will be found where wisdom
is not. It will be found where the natural sympathy
of the mind is robbed of encouragement. It will be found
where cruelty is taught; and the voice of kindness is not
heard in the murderous shrieks of agony which brutal
violence enforces upon the ignorant and misguided criminal.
It is not heard in the wild roar of damnation, as it
rings from minds, educated in the mythology of pagan
and taught in the place where the merciful spirit of Jesus
is professedly adored. Adored! Heaven forbid. Where
his religion of peace is mocked with peals of cruelty, and
his voice of compassion is scorned to vent the outpourings
of judgment upon the credulous and unsuspecting. These
wrongs nature will not justify. They are wrongs which no
religion will make right, without the wisdom of heaven to
aid. They are wrongs which will meet with no approval
in this circle. They are cruelties which make minds cruel,
and therefore disobedient to God. They are miseries
which induce miseries, and cultivate evils among minds in
the rudimental world. They are evils which, when you
go on a mission to overcome them, will be sustained with
minds in harmony with them. Soon thou must go, and
when thou goest, let thy words be peace.</p>

<p>M. Know we not that your wisdom will be discarded?</p>

<p>W. The wisdom which I would teach will be discarded
by those who love darkness rather than light, because their
deeds are evil. The pure will receive the message, because
they have no works of evil, which they wish to justify by
evil doctrines and creeds. The good will not oppose good,
because nature will not oppose itself. The wise will not
oppose wisdom, because wisdom can not uphold folly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>M. But when you go on your mission, are there not
some minds, in this sphere, who will attempt to baffle your
efforts?</p>

<p>W. There are some, yea, many minds, in this sphere,
who will not teach the philosophy of nature in its purity.
They will not teach any philosophy, save that which is
consonant with their measure of wisdom. They will
teach the wisdom which is consistent with nature, according
to their respective understandings.</p>

<p>M. If then, one mind denies the wisdom you teach, will it
not create distrust among the minds in the body?</p>

<p>W. It will not create wrong; for that already exists.
It will not disprove the wisdom I teach, though it may
create distrust among minds incompetent to decide upon
the merits of the question. Minds in the body will be
prepared to discriminate between truth and error, wisdom
and folly, so that a contradiction of the philosophy I shall
teach, will leave the mind scope for a comparison of my
instruction with the volume of nature. When the mind,
instructed in my philosophy, shall find it corroborated with
the evidence of nature before it, no wisdom which shall
contradict it, will overthrow my positions. If my philosophy
contradict nature, it is well that others should contradict
my error.</p>

<p>M. But how are minds, who are ignorant of the relation
of cause and effect, ignorant of nature and its laws,
ignorant of themselves and of God, to know which doctrine
is true?</p>

<p>W. By experience and investigation. Minds in this
sphere will be instructed by our mission to the rudimental
world. They will unite with us in convincing minds in
the body of the reality of this sphere. They will co-operate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
with us in relieving mind from all uncertainty and doubt
of the immortality of the soul. They will rob death of its
sting, and the grave of its victory. They will tell many
facts which earth’s inhabitants do not know. They will
do good, and not evil; and, as they do good, so evil
will be overcome. They will warn all of the condition of
themselves; for whatever may be the character of communications
imparted to minds in the body, they must
correspond with the condition of the communicator. If
dissimilar sentiments shall be taught, it will prove to the
minds receiving them, that dissimilar minds occupy heaven
as well as earth. The tree will be known by its fruit.
The whole sphere of wisdom will be thus developed. Thou
wilt see, that, if thy circle only were to communicate, a
great error and wrong would be impressed upon the receiver.
He would judge thy teaching as the universal
sentiment of this sphere, and harbor the idea that the indolent
of earth, and the cruel among mankind, were even
as thou art; and, thou seest the wrong which such partial
unfoldings of this sphere, would induce, and the negligence
it would occasion. To develop the realities of this
sphere, it is necessary that each circle should develop itself.
I would say, that each circle, possessing the capacity to
communicate, should unfold its own wisdom. Thus, when
the elevated circles describe the lower, the communications,
emanating therefrom, will establish the description.</p>

<p>The various circles and degrees of wisdom in this sphere,
will find corresponding affinities in the body. Thou wilt
see that all circles will advance circles to their own position
of wisdom. Minds will correct minds, the higher controlling
the lower, until the lower shall become as the higher.
Thou wilt not find all minds equal to thy own, but thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
wilt instruct them until they shall agree with thee in all
things. Minds in the body will be elevated to the seventh
circle in wisdom, but progress and labor must do the work.</p>

<p>M. Minds in the body will deny the revealments you
will make, because they are conflicting.</p>

<p>W. When minds in the body deny revealments, because
they are conflicting, they deny the realities of this
sphere. When they deny the realities of this sphere, because
all minds are not equally developed in wisdom, consistency
would allow them to deny the realities of the
rudimental state. Will the philosopher deny a fact, because
the ignorant contradict it? Will the mathematician
contradict a demonstration, because the blind and foolish
have not beheld it? Will nature reverse her laws, because
ignorance has complained of their inharmony? Will God
cease to be God, because weakness is incredulous of his
wonderful works? Will science disown her pupils, because
ignorance has her votaries? Will wrong work righteousness,
because the deceived have not seen the evil? Will
mercy work cruelty, because cruelty doubts the divinity
of sympathy?</p>

<p>Ignorance will act consistent with its nature. The wisdom
of this sphere will be unfolded, and, when it is unfolded,
the rudimental world will be able to judge of this
sphere, as it actually is, and not from mere speculations
of fancy, or wrong information. They will be able to
judge of the truth of whatever may be communicated by
the nature of the communication. If it disagree with nature
and reason, the wise will not receive it, and the folly of
the unwise will be corrected by their disappointment. The
unwise must learn wisdom to be wise, and if they will
not receive it from the wise, but follow the advice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the unwise, disappointment will correct the folly which
they have received. There will arise many who will dispute
the truth. The wrong will correct itself, when wrong
is discovered. The discovery is sometimes brought to the
mind by disappointment, and sometimes by wise counsel;
but when the latter fails, the former must perform its
office to remove the evil.</p>

<p>The aid and wisdom of this circle will write with mediums.
When wisdom is written, it will not act adversely
to human good; and, when folly is written, it will be
detected by minds. The work of writing will require
great care on your part. Such is the physical and mental
condition of minds, that we intend to make a great change
in them, before we write what will be necessary. The
writing will not be the commencement of our work, but
will follow other manifestations as soon as will be expedient.
But we shall write what will be profitable, and what is
adapted to mind. The writing will be executed with
great rapidity, when mediums shall become wholly passive.</p>

<p>M. The mediums of writing will not write with spirits
who oppose them, I apprehend.</p>

<p>W. Mediums will not oppose what they know. They
will oppose what they do not understand, if it shall conflict
with their views; and, especially, such as are conscientious
in their convictions of truth. They will not write without
much discipline, because long-standing opinions will not
easily yield to the voice of invisible facts. The nature of
mind is such, that educational wrongs must be corrected
with progress. They will yield, when the living light of
this sphere shall pour its splendors on benighted humanity.
But no unnatural disturbance of nature will shock the
world. No wisdom can emanate from this circle inconsistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
with the laws by which we are governed. No rude
outbreaks of wisdom will convulse minds, developed in the
mysteries of nature. No minds acquainted with the wisdom
of nature will oppose our philosophy. The weak
may oppose, but weakness can not withstand wisdom.
They may cavil with its teachings, but they can not overcome
its influence. The weak may oppose what conflicts
with their established sentiments, but progress will increase
their strength. Some mediums will cavil with what will
be revealed; but such will be the uneasiness of their condition,
that they will find it more convenient to write what
we wish than to oppose it. Indeed, mediums will resist
our control for a season, but their resistance will be so unsatisfactory
to themselves, that they will yield; and, when
they yield, they will become as others who have made no
effort to resist the force of our communications.</p>

<p>Another mind wished to know, if manifestations from
this sphere would not disturb the established forms of worship,
and subvert the order of societies and churches, to
which William replied: “The disturbance of forms and
the overthrow of societies and churches, will not necessarily
take place, except so far as they may be incompatible with
the general good. It is not our object to destroy, but to
establish. We do not propose to lay waste, but to build
up. The mission is not to undo what is wise, but to correct
what is unwise. All forms of worship which are
adapted to the condition of the worshiper, will remain so
long as the good of that mind may require; but no form
will be suffered to remain which abridges the right of conscience.
It will be our mission to relieve mind of servitude
to creeds and forms, which are chains to wrong it of independent
thought. It will be our united wisdom to restore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the rights, which sectarian policy has not guarantied to her
votaries. If the forms of worship suffer improvement, the
worshiper will not be injured. If societies and churches
undergo a revision, the members will not be harmed. If
nations shall acknowledge the rights of nations, the people
will not mourn. To aid minds, collectively and individually,
to be what nature has ordained for their good, is
nothing less than wisdom; and he who well intends, need
have no fears of our intrusion, to change conditions inconsistent
with his good.</p>

<p>“There are no forms of worship in this sphere. Order
is not form, because forms are prescribed rules, requiring
obedience in those who are disinclined to observe them.
Those who are disinclined to observe any form of worship,
will not be compelled by our commands to do otherwise.
The wisdom of this circle will not exact hypocritical submission,
nor extort a profession of veneration for customs
which are unsatisfactory to mind. It has been the folly
of the rudimental world to require professions, which were
burdensome to many who made them. They were incongenial
with their condition, and were, therefore, reluctantly
and not cheerfully observed. In many societies, thou
mayest see a slavish acquiescence in customs and forms,
because the mind cringes to popular respect. It is not free
to do as it desires. It is restrained through fear of those
who would control the rights of conscience. It is compelled
to do service in a prescribed way, or suffer the execration
of those who rule in the church. It wishes to
avoid censure, and consequently yields its natural freedom.
The wrong is grievous to the slave. Religion is weakened
by the tyranny. Human rights of conscience are molested
by the forms of worship. It will be our mission to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
freedom to the mind—give freedom to humanity. It will
be our mission to abolish the tyrant’s power, and let all
minds worship God, as it seemeth good. It will be our
mission to set the captive free, so that, when truth shall be
unfolded, no chains shall fetter investigation. It will be
our mission to raise the standard of reform, and correct
the abuses of power wherever they may exist. Societies
and churches need not fear what wisdom will do for the
good of mind.”</p>

<p>M. There will, then, needs be a change in the forms
of worship, and the order of societies and churches.</p>

<p>W. There will be this lesson first taught, which makes
nothing wrong which is adapted to the good of the individual
and others, and which injures no one. The next
lesson will be repeated, when mind has wisdom to adopt
the first; but we are not willing to make a development
thereof, until conditions shall require it. Indeed, conditions
would seem to forbid it, because of its want of harmony.
Adaptation is harmony with good, for whatever is
harmonious can not be injurious. The mind, acting in
harmony with its own wants, and unrestrained by conditions,
will not be dissatisfied but happy in its sphere. The
mind, which acts as it does not see right and proper, must
act as conflicting conditions make it; and, while acting as
conditions compel, it must be dissatisfied and unhappy.
Dissatisfaction is unhappiness. Minds in this sphere, are
adapted to the conditions around them. The circles have
what they want. There is no inharmony between their
wants and the means to gratify them. The low want what
they have, and they have what they want. It is even so
with all circles; but all circles have not the same wants.
While the low want what will satisfy their condition, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
high want what will satisfy their condition. The wisdom
which is satisfactory to the low, would be very unsatisfactory
to minds above them. Hence, they will say, they
are happy; and they say truly, because, in their ignorance,
they want no more. But mind, elevated in wisdom above
them, would not be happy with what they have. Thus,
wisdom is not unsatisfactory to any mind, and the only
difference is the degree to which each has attained.</p>

<p>Societies and churches on earth have their degrees of
wisdom. What is satisfactory to one would not be to
another. Now, if one society were to compel the other to
adopt its wisdom, a disturbance would necessarily ensue
which would be very likely to make both unhappy. It is
not, therefore, just on the part of one to compel the other
to adopt its creed or form of worship. Such compulsion
would be fatal to the enjoyment of both. It would introduce
a conflict and beget a war, that would disturb their
happiness. Both parties would suffer by it. Hence, all
coercive measures, calculated to make minds hypocrites,
and introduce conflicting minds into one society, are irrational
and unjust; and they who succeed in doing such
work, violate the harmony of nature’s laws, and will receive
their just reward.</p>

<p>In our mission, we shall not disturb congenial relations.
Societies and churches will not be forced into new creeds
contrary to their wishes. But minds, who need a superior
wisdom, will be aided in harmony with their wants. It is
wise to satisfy want. It is unwise to control mind so as to
make it receive what it does not want. The unwise of
earth have attempted to make others wise by compelling
them to act and receive what was contrary to their wants.
The rule was wrong, and unhappiness was the result. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
rule was incongruous with the wants of the mind, and
what is incongruous with want, can never satisfy want,
because incongruous things will not produce satisfaction.</p>

<p>Societies will not be required to change their forms of
worship or their creeds of faith by minds of wise circles.
The minds of wise circles will employ their wisdom to
affect minds, and render them capable of reforming the
externals of religion as adaptation requires. Thou wilt see
that when a mind becomes wise, it will reform its worship,
and make circumstances congenial with itself. It will put
away the unwholesome forms of worldly wisdom, and worship
God in spirit and truth.</p>

<p>When a creed, or form of worship, is made by the wisdom
of the maker, it will not be dissatisfactory to him,
because it is congenial with his wisdom. But, when that
mind becomes wiser, when a change has been wrought in
the soul, it will require a change in the creed and form of
worship, otherwise incongruity will disturb his peace. I
have seen some minds so wedded to their creeds and forms,
that they would not reject them, even when their conditions
demanded it. I have seen these minds profess reverence
for creeds and forms when they had no reverence for
them. I have seen these conditions conflicting with each
other, and the mind distressed with the wrong. I have
seen them acquiesce in measures which they did not believe
consistent with human good, because they had once avowed
a confidence in them. They feared the reproach of others,
and dared not be honest in the sight of God and their own
souls. They concealed their own convictions from the
inspection of the society or church, and yielded submission
to conditions which were unjust and untrue to their peace.
I want a reform of these evils. I want a change in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
minds. I want a harmony between their wisdom and their
professions. I want no discord between mind and God.
I want no hypocritical reverence for forms and ceremonies
not consistent with honest intentions. But I want mind
to worship, as it seemeth good. I want no society or
church creed to make mind virtuous and happy. But
others may want; and may want so long as ignorance
remaineth. While they want, they will be dissatisfied
when denied what will gratify it. Therefore, thou wilt
see that what is not wanted, it is well to destroy. Thou
wilt see that our mission is to change the wants of mind;
to give it a relish for holy things; to make it adapted to a
condition of higher development; to mould it into the
wisdom of a purer sphere; where the wisdom of adaptation
will be appreciated, and harmony result in greater
bliss. Thou wilt aid in this work. Thou shouldst not
refuse to work a reform of conditions, by working a change
in the minds of those who will be affected by them.
When that change is wrought, the forms of worship, and
the creeds of societies, will very easily become changed, so
as to be adapted to the condition of their supporters.</p>

<p>The wisdom of a circle who wish only good, will open
a way for a change of minds, who will reform societies and
churches, so that creeds and forms will harmonize with
their condition of development. It will not be necessary
to change any creed or form of worship, only as it may
disagree with the condition of the worshiper. To change
a form of worship, so as to make it disagree with the wisdom
of the worshiper, would be to exact a hypocritical
profession, than which nothing would be more inconsistent
with the good of mind. To relieve mind of unjust and
unwholesome burdens, will not require unreasonable control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
of such externals of religion, as are adapted to mind.
Nevertheless, as mind becomes changed by wisdom of
higher circles, so the forms and customs, which work harmoniously
with one condition, will need to be changed to
harmonize with a different condition. But, when the mind
becomes changed, so as to require a change of externals, it
will not require great labor to change them also; because
the principle of adaptation, being understood, will necessarily
work the desired reform. We shall not seek to correct
the outward service, but the inner man; and, when
the mind is reformed, the outward condition will become
harmonious with it. If thou wouldst understand more
fully the wisdom of our circle, thou mayest go with us
where no wrong will be done unto thee.</p>

<p>M. Where will you direct my steps?</p>

<p>W. To a mansion which is near thee.</p>

<p>M. May I now go?</p>

<p>W. Thou mayest go, as thou art prepared. There
will be a work required of thee, when thou shalt enter
there.</p>

<p>M. I am ready to do what will be required, if no evil
be designed me or others.</p>

<p>W. No evil will be required of thee. Thou wilt not
be required to do evil but good.</p>

<p>M. Then you may lead me onward.</p>

<p>W. Onward is the word. Onward is progress. Onward
is thy motto. Onward is thy passport. And, when
thou shalt reach the mansion, thou wilt say, Onward.
Onward will admit thee, guide thee, and give thee a wisdom,
thou hast not known. Onward, then, will unfold a
change of thy mind, and qualify thee for usefulness.</p>

<p>We reached the mansion. The mind was received.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Onward did not stop. Onward never stops. It works,
labors, acts, and moves for the good of mind. Dullness
waits, cringes, fears, doubts, moves not. It waits to see, to
know, and to understand the mysteries of nature. It will
wait, and wait in vain. It will wait, and wait without
improvement. It will wait, and improvement will wait also.</p>

<p>When we work an improvement of mind, it will not be
done by waiting. Energy, zeal, industry, onward, will be
our companions. The wisdom of earth must yield to the
wisdom of heaven. The aid of heaven will not wait, but
make all things new. Wise minds will not wait for minds
of other circles to do what is necessary for them to do.
Unwise minds will wait, until they find waiting inconsistent
with progress. Then, they will wait no more.</p>

<p>There will not be wisdom in waiting for disclosures of
facts from this sphere, when facts which have been revealed
are neglected and distrusted. There will be some who
will wait for minds of this sphere to <i>make</i> them work, and
do their duty to humanity, but they will never be satisfied
with waiting. There never can be progress in any mind,
while it waits, and asks spirits to do what belongs to itself.
There never can be advancement with circles while they
omit the essential obligations of duty to others. There
will never be any reform by spirits, who depend wholly on
others to reform them. We sow the seed of wisdom, but
nettles and thorns choke the growth. We sow the principles
of truth, but errors and wrongs are made to destroy
their influence. The weeds of error must be destroyed, or
no reform can be effected. Hence, minds waiting for spirits
to destroy their wrongs, waiting for others to do what they
must do to receive the truth, will wait a profitless season
to see the salvation of their souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>In conclusion of this work, I will say that when this
medium shall wait for us to do what is well for minds in
their conditions, I will write another book. I will write a
continuation of my experience in this sphere. I have succeeded
in presenting a brief period, and a running sketch
of other periods of experience, which will be more completely
written, when this medium shall wait for me to do
it. I will now conclude by saying, that what is written is
without the volition of this medium, and will not suffer
mutilation by compositors or others, without his detection.
I wish to say, that my name has been given, as was promised,
and the reader will find the names of Wm. Penn,
and Emanuel Swedenborg, associated with me. There
will also be given another name in the writings of the next
work.</p>

<p>Having completed this volume, I would very respectfully
dedicate the same to the rudimental world, without
respect to persons.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following article was written for an Album, February
12th, 1852. I sat down with the intention of writing a prose
article, by the request of a lady, without the aid of spirits. When
seated, my mind lost all thought, for a few moments: I had no
design of writing a poetical article, for nature did not make me a
poet, and not much of a judge of poetry. I will say, I never
wrote a line of poetry in my life, unless with the aid of spirits,
since I have been a medium. In about five minutes my hand
began to move, and wrote as follows:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
